WordPress 5.1 is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">scheduled to be released</a> on <strong>Thursday, February 21</strong>, but we need <em>your</em> help to get there—if you haven’t tried 5.1 yet, now is the time!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 release candidate: try the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-RC1.zip\">download the release candidate here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What&#8217;s in WordPress 5.1?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Inspired by Archie Bell &amp; The Drells, WordPress&#8217;s theme for 2019 is to &#8220;tighten up&#8221;, and WordPress 5.1 focussed on exactly that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<iframe class=\'youtube-player\' type=\'text/html\' width=\'632\' height=\'386\' src=\'https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wro3bqi4Eb8?version=3&#038;rel=1&#038;fs=1&#038;autohide=2&#038;showsearch=0&#038;showinfo=1&#038;iv_load_policy=1&#038;wmode=transparent\' allowfullscreen=\'true\' style=\'border:0;\'></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>With security and speed in mind, this release introduces WordPress’s first <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/php-site-health-mechanisms-in-5-1/\">Site Health</a> features. WordPress will start showing notices to administrators of sites that run long-outdated versions of PHP, which is the programming language that powers WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Furthermore, when installing new plugins, WordPress&#8217;s Site Health features will check whether a plugin requires a version of PHP incompatible with your site. If so, WordPress will prevent you from installing that plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new block editor has kept improving since its introduction in WordPress 5.0. Most significantly, WordPress 5.1 includes solid performance improvements within the editor. The editor should feel a little quicker to start, and typing should feel smoother. There are more features and performance improvements planned in upcoming WordPress releases, you can check them out in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/gutenberg\">Gutenberg plugin</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Plugin and Theme Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Please test your plugins and themes against WordPress 5.1 and update the <em>Tested up to</em> version in the readme to 5.1. If you find compatibility problems, please be sure to post to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a> so we can figure those out before the final release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress 5.1 Field Guide has also been published, which goes into the details of the major changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-make-wordpress-core\"><div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"wp-embedded-content\" data-secret=\"vJJstvskLt\"><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/08/wordpress-5-1-field-guide/\">WordPress 5.1 Field Guide</a></blockquote><iframe class=\"wp-embedded-content\" sandbox=\"allow-scripts\" security=\"restricted\" src=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/02/08/wordpress-5-1-field-guide/embed/#?secret=vJJstvskLt\" data-secret=\"vJJstvskLt\" width=\"600\" height=\"338\" title=\"&#8220;WordPress 5.1 Field Guide&#8221; &#8212; Make WordPress Core\" frameborder=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n</div></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a> This release also marks the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/glossary/#hard-freeze\">hard string freeze</a>&nbsp;point of the 5.1 release schedule.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>If you think you’ve found a bug</strong>, you can post to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\">Alpha/Beta area</a>&nbsp;in the support forums.

See our guide on the difference between <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/self-hosted-wordpress-org-vs-free-wordpress-com-infograph/\" title=\"Self Hosted WordPress.org vs. Free WordPress.com [Infograph]\">self hosted WordPress.org site vs WordPress.com blog</a>. </p>\n<p>In order to get started, you will need a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting\" title=\"How to Choose The Best WordPress Hosting?\">WordPress hosting</a> provider to set up your self hosted WordPress website. </p>\n<p>We recommend <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a> because they are an officially recommended WordPress hosting company, and they are giving WPBeginner users exclusive 60% discount + free domain and SSL. </p>\n<p>Basically, you can get started for $2.75 / month. </p>\n<p><a title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"orangecta\">&rarr; Click Here to Claim This Exclusive Bluehost Offer &larr;</a></p>\n<p>If you want a Bluehost alternative, then take a look at <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/siteground/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Siteground\" rel=\"nofollow\">Siteground</a>. They also have a special offer for WPBeginner users. </p>\n<h4 id=\"changedns\">Step 2: Change DNS Settings</h4>\n<p>Blogger allows you to use any domain name registered by a 3rd party. U.S. based users can also use a domain registered with Google Domains. </p>\n<p>When you first setup the domain pointing to your Blogger blog, you were asked to add CNAME and A records to your domain&#8217;s DNS settings. </p>\n<p>These domain name records help browsers decide where to direct users when they enter your domain name. See our guide on <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/beginners-guide-what-is-a-domain-name-and-how-do-domains-work/\" title=\"Beginner’s Guide: What is a Domain Name and How Do Domains Work?\">domain names and how they work</a>)</p>\n<p>You will need to delete those old records and add your new WordPress host&#8217;s DNS settings. </p>\n<p>You can get DNS settings required by your WordPress hosting company from their documentation or support websites. A typical DNS nameserver looks something like this: </p>\n<p>NS1.Bluehost.com<br />\nNS2.Bluehost.com </p>\n<p>In this guide, we will show you how to update DNS settings in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Godaddy\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/godaddy/\" data-shortcode=\"true\">Godaddy</a>. However the basic settings are the same across all <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-domain-registrar/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best Domain Registrar in 2019 (Compared)\">popular domain registrars</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Changing DNS Settings in GoDaddy</strong></p>\n<p>You need to Login to your Godaddy account and click on the manage button next to domains. After that you need to click on the gear icon next to your domain and then select manage DNS. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Launch DNS management in GoDaddy\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/managedns.png\" alt=\"Launch DNS management in GoDaddy\" width=\"550\" height=\"365\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60116\" /></p>\n<p>You will see your domain information page. Next, you need to click on the DNS Zone File. This is where all the DNS level records for your domain are stored. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Edit DNS zone file in GoDaddy\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/dnszonefile.png\" alt=\"Edit DNS zone file in GoDaddy\" width=\"550\" height=\"302\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60117\" /></p>\n<p>On the DNS Zone File page, you need to locate the A record and CNAME aliases you added for your Blogger blog and delete them. </p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to click on the save changes button to apply your changes. </p>\n<p>The next step is to setup nameservers for your WordPress hosting provider. </p>\n<p>Go back to manage DNS page for your domain and then click on &#8216;Manage&#8217; under the namservers section.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Manage nameserver settings\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/changenameservers.png\" alt=\"Manage nameserver settings\" width=\"550\" height=\"318\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60120\" /></p>\n<p>On the next page, you need to click on &#8216;Custom&#8217; and then click on edit nameservers link to add your new WordPress hosts nameservers. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding nameservers\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/nameserver.png\" alt=\"Adding nameservers\" width=\"550\" height=\"202\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60118\" /></p>\n<p>Click on the save button to make your DNS changes go live. </p>\n<p><strong>Important:</strong> DNS changes may take anywhere between a few hours to one or even two days to fully propagate. During this time, you can access your Blogger blog by logging into your account. </p>\n<h4 id=\"removeredirect\">Step 3: Remove Domain Redirect</h4>\n<p>Your Blogger blog&#8217;s original blogspot.com address is redirecting users to your custom domain. Since we have changed the domain settings, we need to remove this from Blogger too. </p>\n<p>Simply log into your Blogger account and go to <strong>Settings &raquo; Basic</strong> page. Under the publishing section, click on the cross icon to cancel the redirect. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Remove custom domain redirect from Blogger\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/removeredirect.png\" alt=\"Remove custom domain redirect from Blogger\" width=\"550\" height=\"284\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60123\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"installwp\">Step 4: Install WordPress</h4>\n<p>If your domain&#8217;s DNS has propagated now, then you can install WordPress on your hosting provider. </p>\n<p>If your domain is registered on a 3rd party service other than your web host, then you will need to add the hosting for the domain. </p>\n<p>For example, in <a rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" data-shortcode=\"true\">Bluehost</a> you will add your domain as an Addon domain through cPanel unless it is the main domain on your account. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding a domain name to your hosting account\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/add-domain-hosting.png\" alt=\"Adding a domain name to your hosting account\" width=\"550\" height=\"358\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60111\" /></p>\n<p>After adding domain to your new host, the next step is to install WordPress. Most hosting companies have simple 1-click WordPress installers that you can use to quickly install WordPress. </p>\n<p>If you need more help, then follow the instructions in our complete <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/how-to-install-wordpress/\" title=\"How to Install WordPress\">WordPress installation tutorial</a>. </p>\n<p>After successful installation of WordPress on your custom domain, you will be ready to import content from your Blogger blog. </p>\n<h4 id=\"exportcontent\">Step 5: Export Content From Blogger</h4>\n<p>Before you can import content into WordPress, first you need to export it from your Blogger blog. </p>\n<p>Blogger allows you to export content in an XML file. </p>\n<p>Simply login to your Blogger blog and visit <strong>Settings &raquo; Other</strong> page. Under the blog tools, click on the Backup Content link.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Export blog posts from Blogger\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backupcontent.png\" alt=\"Export blog posts from Blogger\" width=\"550\" height=\"364\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60124\" /></p>\n<p>This will bring up a popup where you need to click on the &#8216;Save to your computer&#8217; button.</p>\n<p>Depending on the file size, it may take a few seconds or a few minutes. Once you have your data, it is time to import it into your WordPress site.</p>\n<h4>Step 6: Import Blogger Blog into WordPress</h4>\n<p>Login to your WordPress admin area and visit <strong>Tools &raquo; Import</strong> page. There you will see a list of importers for different services. You need to click on Blogger to install the Blogger importer. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Install Blogger importer tool for WordPress\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/bloggerimport.png\" alt=\"Install Blogger importer tool for WordPress\" width=\"550\" height=\"324\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60125\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress will now download and install the Blogger Importer plugin for you. Once it is finished installing the plugin, you need to click on Run Importer link to continue.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Run Blogger importer\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/runimporter.png\" alt=\"Run Blogger importer\" width=\"550\" height=\"212\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60126\" /></p>\n<p>On the Import Blogger screen, WordPress will ask you to upload the XML file. Simply click on choose file button and upload the XML file you downloaded earlier. Click on the Upload file and import button to continue.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Upload file to import\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/uploadtoimport.png\" alt=\"Upload file to import\" width=\"550\" height=\"212\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60127\" /></p>\n<p>WordPress will now import your blog posts from Blogger, once it is finished you will be asked to assign an author to the imported posts. You can assign your blogger posts to an existing author or create a new one. </p>\n<p>Congratulations! you have successfully imported your Blogger blog into WordPress. </p>\n<p>However, you still need to make sure that you don’t lose any search rankings by redirecting search engines and visitors to the same content on your new WordPress powered website.</p>\n<h4 id=\"setuppermalinks\">Step 7: Setup Permalinks</h4>\n<p>WordPress comes with a feature that allows you to set up <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/seo-friendly-url-structure-for-wordpress/\" title=\"SEO Friendly URL Structure for WordPress\">SEO friendly URL structure</a>. </p>\n<p>However, since you are importing content from Blogger, you would want your permalink structure to be as close to your Blogger URL structure as possible. To set permalinks you need to go to <strong>Settings &raquo; Permalinks</strong> and paste this in the custom structure field:</p>\n<p><code>/%year%/%monthnum%/%postname%.html</code></p>\n<p><img title=\"Change permalinks\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/fixpermalinks.png\" alt=\"Change permalinks\" width=\"550\" height=\"333\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60129\" /></p>\n<h4 id=\"redirectfeeds\">Setp 8: Setup Feed Redirects</h4>\n<p>You have successfully redirected your Blogger blog to WordPress. However, users who have subscribed to your Blogger RSS feed will stop receiving updates. </p>\n<p>You need to redirect feed requests to your WordPress feeds. This can be easily achieved by editing the .htaccess file in your WordPress site&#8217;s root folder. </p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find your .htaccess file, then see <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/why-you-cant-find-htaccess-file-on-your-wordpress-site/\" title=\"Why You Can’t Find .htaccess File on Your WordPress Site\">this tutorial</a>.</p>\n<p>Start by connecting to your WordPress site using an <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/glossary/ftp/\" title=\"FTP\">FTP client</a>. You will need to enable &#8216;Show Hidden Files&#8217; option in your FTP client settings. If you are using Filezilla, you will find this option under Server menu. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Show hidden files in FTP\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/showhiddenfiles.png\" alt=\"Show hidden files in FTP\" width=\"550\" height=\"189\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60130\" /></p>\n<p>Once you are connected to your website, you will find the .htaccess file in your WordPress site&#8217;s root directory. You need to edit this file and paste the following code before any other code in the file. </p>\n<pre class=\"brush: php; title: ; notranslate\">\r\n&lt;IfModule mod_rewrite.c&gt;\r\n   RewriteEngine on\r\n   RewriteRule atom.xml /feed? [L,R=301]\r\n   RewriteRule rss.xml /feed? [L,R=301]\r\n   RewriteRule ^feeds/posts/?.*$ /feed? [L,R=301]\r\n   RewriteRule ^feeds/comments/?.*$ /comments/feed? [L,R=301]\r\n&lt;/IfModule&gt;\r\n</pre>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget to save your changes and upload the .htaccess file back to the server. Your Blogger feed subscribers will now be redirected to your WordPress site&#8217;s feed. </p>\n<h4 id=\"customizingwp\">Step 9. Customizing Your WordPress Site</h4>\n<p>Themes control the appearance of your WordPress site. You can use them to change your website&#8217;s colors, layout, navigation menus, and more. </p>\n<p><img title=\"WordPress themes\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wpthemes-1.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress themes\" width=\"550\" height=\"349\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-60131\" /></p>\n<p>By default, WordPress comes with a very simple theme that doesn&#8217;t offer many features. </p>\n<p>Luckily, there are thousands of WordPress themes available that you can choose from.</p>\n<p>Following are a few of our showcases with our expert-pick of best WordPress themes in different categories. </p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-free-wordpress-blog-themes/\" title=\"59 Best Free WordPress Blog Themes for 2019\">Best free WordPress blog themes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/37-simple-wordpress-themes-you-should-try/\" title=\"41 Best Simple WordPress Themes You Should Try (2019)\">Best simple WordPress themes</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-minimalist-wordpress-themes-for-writers/\" title=\"26 Best Minimalist WordPress Themes for Writers\">Best wordpress themes for writers</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are a few tips that you should consider when looking at these themes. </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Simplicity is the best design.

Let&#8217;s get started. </p>\n<h4 id=\"difference\">What is an Amazon Affiliate Store?</h4>\n<p>An Amazon affiliate store is an online store that promotes products listed for sale on Amazon.com.  </p>\n<p>As a store owner, you send traffic to Amazon by adding your affiliate links to the products. Users are redirected to Amazon to complete the purchase, and you earn an affiliate commission on each sale.  </p>\n<p>On a traditional online store, you source products, manage orders, ship products, and keep track of inventory. You don&#8217;t have to worry about any of these things on an affiliate store. </p>\n<p>Amazon affiliate stores are popular among marketers because you can get started with very little money and choose from millions of products listed on Amazon. </p>\n<h4 id=\"gettingstarted\">Getting Started With Amazon Affiliate Store and WordPress</h4>\n<p>You can start an Amazon affiliate store with just about any <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/plugins/best-wordpress-ecommerce-plugins-compared/\" title=\"5 Best WordPress Ecommerce Plugins Compared – 2019\">WordPress eCommerce plugin</a>, but we recommend using WooCommerce because it&#8217;s the most popular solution in the market.</p>\n<p>WooCommerce powers millions of eCommerce websites all over the world.</p>\n<p>To get started, you will need to be using the WordPress.org platform (See the difference between <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/self-hosted-wordpress-org-vs-free-wordpress-com-infograph/\" title=\"WordPress.com vs WordPress.org – Which is Better? (Comparison Chart)\">WordPress.com vs WordPress.org</a>).</p>\n<p>You will also need a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best WordPress Hosting?\">WordPress hosting</a> account, a domain name, and an SSL certificate if you want to accept payments for other non-affiliate products on your website. </p>\n<p>Typically, a domain name costs around $14.99 / year, web hosting costs around $7.99 / month, and SSL certificate costs around $69.99 / year. </p>\n<p>If you are just starting out, then this is quite a lot. </p>\n<p>Thankfully, <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost Ecommerce\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a>, an official WordPress and WooCommerce recommended hosting provider, has agreed to offer our users a free domain name, free SSL certificate, and a discount on web hosting.</p>\n<p>Basically, you can get started for $2.75 / month.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Bluehost\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"orangecta\">&rarr; Click here to Claim this Exclusive Bluehost offer &larr;</a></p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> This starter hosting plan would work great for any new affiliate store.

It will walk you through the sign up process, and setting up WordPress. </p>\n<p>Once you have installed WordPress, you&#8217;ll reach the WordPress dashboard which looks like this. </p>\n<p><img title=\"WordPress admin dashboard\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpdashboard-1-1.png\" alt=\"WordPress admin dashboard\" width=\"550\" height=\"344\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59979\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you need to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/\" title=\"WooCommerce\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">WooCommerce</a> plugin.

Follow the on-screen instructions to complete your profile. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Affiliate program wizard\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/signupwizard.jpg\" alt=\"Affiliate program wizard\" width=\"550\" height=\"272\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47025\" /></p>\n<p>Upon completion, your application will be reviewed and approved by Amazon. </p>\n<h4 id=\"addproducts\">Adding Amazon Affiliate Products in WooCommerce</h4>\n<p>WooCommerce is the best Amazon affiliate store plugin for WordPress. It makes it very easy to add external affiliate products to your website. </p>\n<p>Using WooCommerce allows you to offer a native user experience and integrate affiliate products seamlessly into your website. </p>\n<p>To start importing products, you need to visit <strong>Products &raquo; Add New</strong> page. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding a new affiliate product in WooCommerce\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/addnewprod.png\" alt=\"Adding a new affiliate product in WooCommerce\" width=\"550\" height=\"292\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47026\" /></p>\n<p>First, you need to provide a title for the product you are adding and then add a detailed description in the post editor. </p>\n<p>After that, scroll down to product data meta box and select &#8216;External/Affiliate Product&#8217; under &#8216;Product type&#8217; dropdown menu.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Product URL\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/producturl.png\" alt=\"Product URL\" width=\"550\" height=\"333\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47322\" /></p>\n<p>Now you need to enter the product affiliate URL. You can get the URL from your Amazon Associates account dashboard. Simply search for the product and then click on the get link button. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Get product link\" src=\"https://cdn2.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/getlink.jpg\" alt=\"Get product link\" width=\"550\" height=\"269\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47028\" /></p>\n<p>Copy the URL and paste it on your product edit page in WordPress. </p>\n<p><strong>Note:</strong> You need to leave the &#8216;Price&#8217; field blank. This will allow users to check the price on Amazon.com. Amazon&#8217;s affiliate program policies do not allow you to manually enter price information. </p>\n<p>Below the product data, you can provide a short description of the product. This description will appear on the shop front page, product category pages, and search results. </p>\n<p>To your right, you can add a product image and product gallery images. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Product images\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/productimage.png\" alt=\"Product images\" width=\"550\" height=\"394\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-47324\" /></p>\n<p>You can now click on the publish button to make the product page go live on your website. </p>\n<p>Repeat the process for adding more affiliate products to your website.

You can change that by picking up a WooCommerce ready WordPress theme that compliments your products and niche. </p>\n<p><img title=\"WordPress themes\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpthemes-1.jpg\" alt=\"WordPress themes\" width=\"550\" height=\"349\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59588\" /> </p>\n<p>There are thousands of WordPress themes that you can choose from.

Amazon has a strict content policy where you are not allowed to copy product content directly from Amazon. </p>\n<p>Most Amazon affiliate stores add their own product descriptions, reviews, and get images from the product manufacturer&#8217;s website.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Can I add products from other affiliate networks?</strong> </p>\n<p>Yes, you can add affiliate products from other affiliate networks. This will allow you to diversify your earnings. </p>\n<p><strong>3. I live outside the United States, can I join Amazon Affiliate program?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you can. Amazon Affiliates program is available all over the world. </p>\n<p><strong>4. Do I need to disclose my affiliate partnership?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you do. Amazon&#8217;s program policies and the US laws require you to disclose that you&#8217;ll earn a commission when users buy a product. </p>\n<p>It is not just limited to Amazon, all websites that use advertising or affiliate marketing to make money are required to do so. For example, see <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wpbeginner-disclaimer/\" title=\"WPBeginner Disclaimer\">WPBeginner&#8217;s disclaimer</a> page. </p>\n<p><strong>5. Can I promote Amazon products without creating an affiliate store?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes, you can. For example, if you run a blog, then you can <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wp-tutorials/how-to-cloak-affiliate-links-on-your-wordpress-site/\" title=\"How to Cloak Affiliate Links on Your WordPress Site\">add affiliate links to your blog posts</a>.

For example, john@myphotostudio.com is a professional email address. </p>\n<p>Email accounts on free email services like john.photographer@gmail.com are not good for business because they do not look professional. Your customers and other businesses will find a professional email address more trustworthy. </p>\n<p>For a professional email address, you will need a domain name and a website. We have step by step guides on how to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/tips-and-tools-to-pick-the-best-domain-for-your-blog/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best Domain Name (8 Tips and Tools)\">choose a domain name</a> and how to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/guides/\" title=\"How to Make a Website in 2019 – Step by Step Guide\">quickly make a website</a>.</p>\n<p>If you already have a domain name and a website, then you are all set to have your own professional email address.</p>\n<h4>Why Use G Suite for Professional Branded Email Address?</h4>\n<p>You might be thinking why use G Suite when most <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-hosting/\" title=\"WordPress Hosting\">WordPress hosting</a> companies offer unlimited email accounts with your own domain name?</p>\n<p>Email is one of the most important communication tool for business owners. If you miss an important email, then it can hurt your business.</p>\n<p>Most web hosting email servers are unreliable, restrictive, isolated, and less secure. You wouldn&#8217;t even know if the email you sent was actually delivered. </p>\n<p>This is where <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/google-apps-work/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Google Apps for Work\" rel=\"nofollow\">G Suite</a> and Gmail comes in. </p>\n<p>Gmail is the industry leader in email with 1.5 billion monthly active users. G Suite is Google&#8217;s productivity app suite for business owners which includes Gmail and is already used by over 4 million businesses and 80 million students / educators.  </p>\n<p>G Suite works with your own domain name, which allows you to use Gmail to create your professional branded email address. </p>\n<p>Here are some of the benefits of using G Suite and Gmail for a professional email address: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>Professional business email address on your own domain.</li>\n<li>Gmail&#8217;s rock solid security and spam filters.</li>\n<li>30 GB &#8211; Double the storage of a free Gmail Account. </li>\n<li>Manage email even when offline using Gmail app on mobile devices.</li>\n<li>Works anywhere web, mobile, tablet, you name it.</li>\n<li>Works great with Outlook and can even sync old Outlook accounts.</li>\n<li>Each user can have up to 30 email aliases.</li>\n<li>Use Google Calendar, Google Hangouts for chat, video, and voice calls on your own business email address.</li>\n<li>No advertisements  and 24/7 professional support whenever you need help.</li>\n<li>Works seamlessly with your WordPress site.</li>\n<li>Most important of all, high deliverability, no delays, no ending up in spam folder.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you know why using G Suite for professional emails is important, let&#8217;s take a look at how to set up a branded professional email address with G Suite. </p>\n<p><strong>Editor&#8217;s Note:</strong> We use G Suite for all of our professional email addresses and can honestly say it&#8217;s the best.</p>\n<h4>Setting up a Professional Email Address with Gmail (G Suite)</h4>\n<p>First you will need to signup for a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/google-apps-work/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"G Suite\" rel=\"nofollow\">G Suite</a> account. </p>\n<p>It costs around $5/month for each user. If you pay annually, then you get 2 months free ($50/year per user).</p>\n<p>G Suite also offers a free 14-day trial, which allows you to test drive everything before you make up your mind. Basically its all the powerful features you&#8217;re used to of Gmail, Drive, Calendar, etc (but now it&#8217;s for your business). </p>\n<p>Simply visit the <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/refer/google-apps-work/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"G Suite\" rel=\"nofollow\">G Suite</a> website and click on the Get Started button for the plan you want to use. </p>\n<p><img title=\"Get started with G Suite\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gsuite-getstarted.jpg\" alt=\"Get started with G Suite\" width=\"550\" height=\"347\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59764\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you need to enter your business name, the number of employees, and the country where you are located. You can choose just yourself for 1 user account, or choose the number of employees.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Choose users\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/chooseusers.png\" alt=\"Choose users\" width=\"550\" height=\"314\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59765\" /></p>\n<p>Click on the next button to continue.</p>\n<p>On the next step, you will be asked to enter your personal contact information including name and email address.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Enter contact info\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/contactinfo.png\" alt=\"Enter contact info\" width=\"550\" height=\"282\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59767\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you will be asked to choose a domain name. If you already have a domain name, then click on ‘Yes I have one I can use’. Otherwise, click on &#8216;No, I need one&#8217; to register a domain name.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Choose domain name\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/domainname.png\" alt=\"Choose domain name\" width=\"550\" height=\"260\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59768\" /></p>\n<p>If you need to register a new domain name, then you will be charged separately for registering a new domain name (tip: here&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-register-a-domain-name-simple-tip-to-get-it-for-free/\" title=\"How to Register a Domain Name (+ simple tip to get it for FREE)\">how to register a domain name for free</a>).</p>\n<p>If you are using an existing domain name, then you will need to verify ownership of the domain name. We&#8217;ll show you how to do that later in this article. </p>\n<p>In the next step, you will be asked to create your G Suite user account by entering a username and password.</p>\n<p>This username will also be your first professional email address, so you need to choose a username that you want to use as your professional email address.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Create your first G Suite user account\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/createaccount.jpg\" alt=\"Create your first G Suite user account\" width=\"550\" height=\"339\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59769\" /></p>\n<p>You have successfully created your G Suite account.

If you want to create more accounts for your employees or departments, then you can do that here.</p>\n<p>You can also just click on &#8216;I have added all user email addresses&#8217; and click on the next button.</p>\n<p>Remember, you can always add more users to your account and create their email addresses later when needed.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Successfully added users\" src=\"https://cdn3.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/addusers.jpg\" alt=\"Successfully added users\" width=\"550\" height=\"266\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59772\" /></p>\n<p>If you registered your domain name elsewhere, then you will now be asked to verify your ownership of the domain name.</p>\n<p>After that you will see a HTML code snippet that you need to add to your website.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Copy meta tag to verify your ownership of domain name\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/copymetatag.jpg\" alt=\"Copy meta tag to verify your ownership of domain name\" width=\"550\" height=\"285\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59775\" /></p>\n<p>There are other ways to verify your website ownership as well. You can upload a HTML file to your website using an FTP client or file manager app in your hosting account dashboard.</p>\n<p>If you don’t have a website, then you can use also use the MX Record method. You will see step by step instructions to do that once you choose this method.</p>\n<p>For the sake of this tutorial, we are assuming that you already have a <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/start-a-wordpress-blog/\" title=\"How to Start a WordPress Blog the RIGHT WAY in 7 Easy Steps (2019)\">WordPress blog</a>, and we will show you how to add the verification HTML code snippet in WordPress. </p>\n<p>Switch to the WordPress admin area in a new browser tab to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-headers-and-footers/\" title=\"Insert Headers and Footer\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Insert Headers and Footer</a> plugin.

Users who registered their domain names via Google, don&#8217;t need to add MX records. </p>\n<p>Since your domain name is not registered with Google, your emails will reach your domain name, but not to the Google servers.</p>\n<p>You will need to set up the right MX records on your domain name settings, so Google’s servers can send and receive emails for your business.</p>\n<p>To do that, you will need to login to your web hosting account, or your <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-domain-registrar/\" title=\"How to Choose the Best Domain Registrar in 2019 (Compared)\">domain registrars</a> account.</p>\n<p>We will show you how to add MX records in Bluehost, but the basic concept is the same on all hosts and domain registrars.

You need to switch back to your G Suite setup screen and check the box that says ‘I have opened the control panel of my domain name’.</p>\n<p>It will now show you the MX records that you need to enter. You will also see a link to the documentation which shows you how to add these records to dozens of hosting and domain services provider.</p>\n<p>Here is how you will add this information to your Bluehost DNS settings:</p>\n<p><img title=\"Adding MX records to your domain name\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/mxbluehost.jpg\" alt=\"Adding MX records to your domain name\" width=\"550\" height=\"249\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59779\" /></p>\n<p>Click on ‘Add Record’ button to save it.

You will see the MX records you created earlier along with an older MX record still pointing to your website.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Delete old MX record\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/deleteoldmx.jpg\" alt=\"Delete old MX record\" width=\"550\" height=\"200\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59781\" /></p>\n<p>Click on the delete button next to the old MX record to delete it.</p>\n<p>After that, switch back to the G Suite setup screen and check the box that says ‘I deleted existing MX records’.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Save MX records\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/savemxrecords.jpg\" alt=\"Save MX records\" width=\"550\" height=\"304\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59782\" /></p>\n<p>You will now be asked to save your MX records. For some providers, once you add MX records they are already saved, for others you may need to manually save MX records.</p>\n<p>Once you have saved MX records, check the box that says ‘I have saved MX records’ in G Suite setup.</p>\n<p><img title=\"Verify domain setup\" src=\"https://cdn.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/verifydomainsetup.jpg\" alt=\"Verify domain setup\" width=\"550\" height=\"378\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59783\" /></p>\n<p>After that, you need to click on ‘Verify domain and setup email’ button to exit the setup wizard.</p>\n<h4>Using Your Professional Email with G Suite and Gmail</h4>\n<p>Your email account works like any other Gmail account. You can access it by visiting Gmail Website and sign in with your email address, e.g. john@yourdomain.com. </p>\n<p>You can also manage your G Suite account by visiting the <a href=\"http://admin.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Admin Console for G Suite\" rel=\"nofollow\">admin console</a>. </p>\n<p><img title=\"G Suite admin control panel\" src=\"https://cdn4.wpbeginner.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/gsuiteadmin.jpg\" alt=\"G Suite admin control panel\" width=\"550\" height=\"283\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-59784\" /></p>\n<p>This is where you can add/remove new users to your domain name. Each of your users will have 30 GB storage and all the same features, but they will not have access to the admin console. You can remove those users at any time you want. </p>\n<h4>Troubleshooting G Suite Domain Setup</h4>\n<p>It is likely that your web host may not be using a dashboard like we have shown in the screenshots above. </p>\n<p>G Suite has detailed documentation for many of the popular web hosting and domain registration service providers. Visit, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/a/topic/1611273?\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"Set up MX records (Hosts specific steps)\" rel=\"nofollow\">set up MX records (Hosts specific steps)</a> page and then locate your domain registrar or web host from the list. </p>\n<p>If you do not find your service provider in the list, then you can ask them directly to help you setup G Suite for your domain name. </p>\n<p>We hope this article helped you setup a professional email address with G Suite and Gmail.

Most beginners who&#8217;ve just started their sites don&#8217;t consider list building as important as it actually is. Before long, they realize the value of an email list, and how it can help them get more genuine visitors on their website or blog. And while it&#8217;s never &#8216;too late&#8217; to start building a list of the people whom you think are important for your business, why not get a head start?</p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;re going to show you why you need to build an email list (right away) and how you can build your own email list.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to Email Lists</h3>\n<p>When talking about email lists, what we actually want you to know is the process of collecting data about your potential clients or visitors. This data includes their name, email, phone number, etc.</p>\n<p>There are multiple methods you can use to collect this data and build your own email lists. You&#8217;ll also find many email marketing services on the internet that can help store the data of your email lists and send personalized emails to all your subscribers easily. These email marketing services were built to promote your business and maximize your revenue.</p>\n<p>For example, you can get permission from your users by adding a check option on the subscription form to send regular updates, promotional content, and greetings to them.</p>\n<h3>Why Do You Need an Email List? (Right Away)</h3>\n<p>Many research studies have proven that email marketing is a win-win opportunity. Website visitors who willingly joined your email list and are allowing you to send emails to them are fully interested in your brand or service. These subscribers will read your emails and visit your website. </p>\n<p>You can also convert your subscribers into customers because of the trust you build with them. Email marketing is more personal and beneficial than any other promotional methods, like social media marketing.</p>\n<p>Below, we&#8217;ll list some of the key points on the importance of an email list:</p>\n<p><strong>Customized Emails:</strong> Using an email marketing service, you can create interactive, customized emails for your subscribers. These emails help get more attraction and traffic to your landing pages. You can also take advantage of customized emails when running a promotional campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Targeted Users:</strong> It&#8217;s simple. Sell to those who want to buy from you. The website visitors who joined your subscribers list out of self interest are your most genuine audience and you need them for your business. It&#8217;s easy for you to create an attractive deal and share it with your subscribers. A win-win, again.</p>\n<p><strong>Personalized Content:</strong> Emails are personal and direct. The marketing software you choose does the magic for you by sending emails to your subscribers that mention their names in the email&#8217;s subject. It creates a powerful impact when they see their name pop up in your email. These subscribers will be more likely to read your personalized email than any generic promotional content on a social channel.</p>\n<p><strong>Email is more effective:</strong> When you promote anything on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc., it may get attention but it&#8217;s not the same as the results you&#8217;ll see with an email.<br />\nIn fact, according to DreamGrow, email is a more effective sales and communications channel than social networking sites.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/exacttarget-social-media-vs-email-675x260-e1549652569998.png\" alt=\"social-media-vs-email\" width=\"639\" height=\"239\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229256\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/exacttarget-social-media-vs-email-675x260-e1549652569998.png 639w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/exacttarget-social-media-vs-email-675x260-e1549652569998-300x112.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 639px) 100vw, 639px\" /></p>\n<p>Now that you know why it&#8217;s important for you to have an email list, the next thing you&#8217;ll need to learn is how to build one.</p>\n<h3>How to Build an Email List (Step-by-Step)</h3>\n<p>Before we start, you should know that building an email list can take time. It&#8217;s an on-going process and you&#8217;ll need to be patient. You&#8217;ll also need a few tools to build your own email list like a website or personal blog, an email marketing software, subscription forms, convertible optin popups, etc.</p>\n<p>If you have a website or blog, then you can go ahead and start creating a subscription form.

This form can be simple, including just name and email fields.</p>\n<p>To create a subscription form on your WordPress site, you&#8217;ll need to install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"WPForms\">WPForms</a> plugin.

It enables you to send fully customized emails to all users on the list.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/emailmarketing.jpg\" alt=\"Email marketing\" width=\"775\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228417\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/emailmarketing.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/emailmarketing-300x139.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/emailmarketing-768x357.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also track how many emails are opened and create custom reports to send more effective emails.

Why?</p>\n<p>Because the users visited your website once and didn&#8217;t subscribe to your email list are gone. You may not see them on your website ever again. That means you need to take action before they leave your site.

But you can do it manually and we can show you how. </p>\n<p>In this article, we&#8217;ll show you how to migrate GoDaddy website builder site to WordPress, step by step. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick table of contents to guide you through the steps in this article:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"#hosting\">Choose Website Hosting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#backup\">Back up Your GoDaddy Website Builder Content</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#link\">Back up our Link Structure</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#point\">Point Your Domain to WordPress Hosting</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#wordpress\">Install WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#import\">Import Your GoDaddy Website Content in WordPress</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#redirects\">Setup Redirects</a></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now&#8217;s let&#8217;s get started on how to move GoDaddy website builder site to WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Benefits of Moving from GoDaddy to WordPress</h3>\n<p>WordPress is the most popular content management system (CMS) in the world and it powers over <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/interesting-wordpress-stats-facts/\">75 million sites on the web</a>.</p>\n<p>A site built on WordPress comes with a number of benefits including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Limitations</strong> &#8211; With WordPress you can build, customize, and grow your website any way you like without limitations.</li>\n<li><strong>Easy Customization</strong> &#8211; WordPress offers a ton of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-free-wordpress-blog-themes/\">free themes</a> that allow you to create a great-looking website in an instant.</li>\n<li><strong>Added Power</strong> &#8211; You get access to thousands of free WordPress plugins to make your website even more powerful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>With all of these benefits, you can be sure that your choice to move your site from GoDaddy to WordPress is a good one.</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that there are 2 different WordPress platforms, WordPress.org and WordPress.com. We recommend you move your GoDaddy website builder site to WordPress.org. Check out our other post for a detailed explanation of the <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-one-really-better/\">differences between WordPress.com and WordPress.org</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"hosting\">1. GoDaddy to WordPress: Choose WordPress Hosting</h3>\n<p>In order to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\">make a website on WordPress</a>, you need WordPress hosting. Website hosting is where your site is hosted and your files are stored. </p>\n<p>If you already have hosting with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/godaddy-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >GoDaddy&#8217;s hosting service</a>, then you&#8217;re good to go! You can use GoDaddy&#8217;s hosting service with your new WordPress site. </p>\n<p>But if you need to choose a new hosting service for your WordPress site, we recommend choosing <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer.png\" alt=\"bluehost-wordpress-hosting\" width=\"740\" height=\"404\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228328\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bluehost is one of the most popular hosting companies in the world and it&#8217;s an officially recommended hosting provider by WordPress.org. Plus, IsItWP readers get an awesome deal when they sign up with Bluehost. </p>\n<p>They&#8217;re offering our users a free domain name, free SSL, and 65% off on WordPress hosting. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"btn ltgreen light\">Click Here to Claim This Exclusive Bluehost Offer &raquo;</a></p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a>, you&#8217;ll only be paying as low as $2.75 per month to start your WordPress website. </p>\n<p>If you later decide you want to switch your WordPress site to another web host, check out our post on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/switch-one-web-host-another-without-downtime-step-by-step/\">how to move from one web host to another without any downtime</a>. </p>\n<h3 id=\"backup\">2. Back up Your GoDaddy Website Builder Content</h3>\n<p>Before you start to move GoDaddy website builder site to WordPress, you need to back up your website content. If you have just a couple pages of content and images, then you can back up by simply copying the text into text files on your computer and saving the images to your computer as well. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backup-site.jpg\" alt=\"backup-site\" width=\"740\" height=\"386\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229089\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backup-site.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backup-site-300x156.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>To better organize your backup content, you can save all of your homepage text in a text editor file called &#8220;Homepage&#8221; and all of your homepage images in a folder called &#8220;Homepage&#8221; and so on. Do this for each page of your website. </p>\n<p>Another quick option to back up your website content is to visit each of your website pages on your browser. On your keyboard, press CTRL+S (Command+S for Mac), this will bring up the save dialog box. Make sure to choose &#8220;Webpage, Complete&#8221; in the &#8220;format&#8221; or &#8220;save as type&#8221; field. Save each of your website pages this way. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backup-site-2.jpg\" alt=\"backup-site-to-move-wordpress\" width=\"740\" height=\"379\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229090\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backup-site-2.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/backup-site-2-300x154.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also use a free tool like <a href=\"https://www.httrack.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">HTTrack</a> which allows you to save any web page to your PC. Just download HTTrack and enter in the URL of your website. The tool will then make a copy of your website on your computer.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/htttrack.jpg\" alt=\"httrack-tool\" width=\"740\" height=\"392\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229092\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/htttrack.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/htttrack-300x159.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /> </p>\n<p>HTTrack is certainly a faster way to backup all of your website files. The only downside is that since the GoDaddy website builder and its themes store their files on different CDN servers, which makes it difficult to download all of your images. So, if your website is mostly text and you don&#8217;t mind losing your images, HTTrack is a fine option. </p>\n<p>Before moving on to the next step of migrating from GoDaddy to WordPress, double-check that you&#8217;ve got all of your website files downloaded. Once you&#8217;ve disabled the website builder, you won&#8217;t be able to get your website back. So, disconnect the internet on your computer and check to see that you&#8217;ve got all of your website data.</p>\n<h3 id=\"link\">3. Backup Your Link Structure</h3>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to back up your link structure. If someone clicks on a URL to your old site, they won&#8217;t be able to find your website. So, you need to redirect all of the users visiting the old URLs of your website to the new URLs on your WordPress site. </p>\n<p>To back up your link structure, you need a full list of all of the URLs on your website. If you don&#8217;t have many, simply copy and paste the URLs to a text file on your computer. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/link-structure.jpg\" alt=\"link-structure-godaddy-to-wordpress\" width=\"740\" height=\"422\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229191\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/link-structure.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/link-structure-300x171.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can use an online tool like <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/link-klipper-extract-all/fahollcgofmpnehocdgofnhkkchiekoo/related?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Klipper</a> to extract URLs from your site and save them to a text file.  </p>\n<h3 id=\"point\">4. Point Your Domain to WordPress Hosting</h3>\n<p>This step is for users who have a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/godaddy-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >domain name registered with GoDaddy</a> and want to use it with another WordPress hosting service like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a> or <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/siteground/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >SiteGround</a>. If you don&#8217;t have a domain name registered with GoDaddy, you can skip this step.  </p>\n<p>To point your domain to other WordPress hosting services, go to your GoDaddy account and navigate to the <strong>Domains</strong> section. Click on the <strong>Manage</strong> button next to the domain you want to change. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-domain-godaddy.jpg\" alt=\"manage-godaddy-domain\" width=\"740\" height=\"269\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229202\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-domain-godaddy.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-domain-godaddy-300x109.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, click on Additional Settings and then click on Manage DNS.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-dns-godaddy.jpg\" alt=\"manage-dns-godaddy\" width=\"740\" height=\"377\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229203\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-dns-godaddy.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/manage-dns-godaddy-300x153.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Now scroll down to the <strong>Nameservers</strong> section and select the <strong>Change</strong> button.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/change-nameservers.jpg\" alt=\"change-nameservers\" width=\"740\" height=\"258\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229205\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/change-nameservers.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/change-nameservers-300x105.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" />  </p>\n<p>Next, click the dropdown to switch the nameserver type to <strong>Custom</strong>. Now you can enter your new WordPress hosts nameservers here. If your WordPress hosting service has more than 2 nameservers, click <strong>Add Nameserver</strong> to add another line. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/custom-nameservers.jpg\" alt=\"custom-nameservers\" width=\"740\" height=\"309\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229206\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/custom-nameservers.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/custom-nameservers-300x125.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>After you&#8217;ve entered in your nameservers, click the <strong>OK</strong> button and then the <strong>Save</strong> button to save your settings. It&#8217;s important to note that DNS changes may take up to 24 hours to take effect, but it typically takes only a few hours. </p>\n<p>When your domain starts pointing to your new WordPress host, you can move on to the next step. </p>\n<h3 id=\"wordpress\">5. Install WordPress</h3>\n<p>Now you need to install WordPress. WordPress is famous for its 5-minute installation, so this should take no time at all. </p>\n<p>Many web hosting companies offer 1-click WordPress installation as well. So, when you sign up for a WordPress hosting service and choose your plan, you can install WordPress right from your hosting service dashboard. Below is what that process looks like when you <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >sign up with Bluehost</a>, but it will be similar for other WordPress hosting services as well. </p>\n<p>First, you&#8217;ll be prompted to choose a WordPress theme. You can choose any theme you want and change it easily at any time you want as well. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pick-a-theme.jpg\" alt=\"installing-wordpress-choose-theme\" width=\"740\" height=\"437\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229195\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pick-a-theme.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/pick-a-theme-300x177.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you&#8217;ll be asked to name your WordPress website and choose a tagline for your site. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-a-new-wordpress-blog.jpg\" alt=\"create-a-new-wordpress-site\" width=\"740\" height=\"450\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229196\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-a-new-wordpress-blog.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-a-new-wordpress-blog-300x182.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>After typing in your details, click <strong>Next</strong>. Now Bluehost will automatically install WordPress for you. When the installation is finished, you&#8217;ll see a <strong>WordPress installed successfully</strong> screen. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wordpress-installation-successful.jpg\" alt=\"godaddy-to-wordpress-installation-success\" width=\"740\" height=\"456\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229193\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wordpress-installation-successful.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wordpress-installation-successful-300x185.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you can log in to your site to start building it and transferring your content to it. An easy way to log in to your WordPress site is by adding <strong>wp-admin</strong> to the end of your URL. </p>\n<p>For example, http://mysite.com/wp-admin. </p>\n<p>A screen will then appear where you can log in to your WordPress site with the login information that was sent to your email. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wordpress-login.jpg\" alt=\"wordpress-login\" width=\"740\" height=\"421\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229194\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wordpress-login.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/wordpress-login-300x171.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<h3 id=\"import\">6. Import Your GoDaddy Website Content in WordPress</h3>\n<p>Now it&#8217;s time to import your content from your GoDaddy website builder site to your new WordPress website. As we mentioned earlier, there is no way to automatically import that content to WordPress so you&#8217;ll have to do it manually. </p>\n<p>WordPress comes with 2 different built-in content types: pages and posts. You need to create pages for your website, for example, an &#8220;About Us&#8221; page, a &#8220;Services&#8221; page, a &#8220;Contact&#8221; page, and so on. You&#8217;ll need to create posts if you <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">want to have a blog</a>. </p>\n<p>Create your pages in WordPress by clicking the <strong>Pages</strong> button in your WordPress dashboard and then clicking <strong>Add New</strong>. To create blog posts, follow the same instructions but choose the <strong>Posts</strong> button instead. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-wordpress-page.jpg\" alt=\"create-wordpress-page\" width=\"740\" height=\"329\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229207\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-wordpress-page.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/create-wordpress-page-300x133.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Now copy the content from your old GoDaddy website builder site that you previously saved and paste it into the WordPress editor. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/import-content.jpg\" alt=\"import-website-builder-content-to-wordpress\" width=\"740\" height=\"334\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229201\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/import-content.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/import-content-300x135.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>When you&#8217;re finished importing the content, click the <strong>Publish</strong> button to make your page live on your website. Repeat this step until all of your GoDaddy website builder content has been imported to WordPress. </p>\n<h3 id=\"redirects\">7. Setup Redirects</h3>\n<p>If you saved a list of links from your old GoDaddy website builder site, you can set up redirects. Redirects tell the search engines that the requested URL has been moved to a new URL. </p>\n<p>You can easily set up redirects using a free WordPress plugin like Simple 301 Redirects. Navigate to the <strong>Plugins</strong> section on your WordPress dashboard, search for &#8220;Simple 301 Redirects&#8221;, and click <strong>Install Now</strong>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/simple-redirects.jpg\" alt=\"simple-301-redirects-plugin\" width=\"740\" height=\"315\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229208\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/simple-redirects.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/simple-redirects-300x128.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Once the plugin is installed and activated, go to <strong>Settings >> 301 Redirects</strong>. In the &#8220;Request&#8221; field, type in your old URL and in the &#8220;Destination&#8221; field, type in your new URL for WordPress. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/settings-redirects.jpg\" alt=\"settings-redirects\" width=\"740\" height=\"242\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-229209\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/settings-redirects.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/settings-redirects-300x98.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Click the <strong>Save Changes</strong> button to save the redirect and repeat the process for all of your other URLs. </p>\n<h3>After a Successful Migration, What&#8217;s Next?</h3>\n<p>Now that your GoDaddy website builder site has been moved from GoDaddy to WordPress, what&#8217;s next?

Building a website can be confusing, especially for beginners. Often, beginners have trouble knowing the difference between a domain name, website hosting, and your website itself. With so many different parts, it can be difficult to understand which part does what and what it all means. </p>\n<p>But don’t worry, we’re here to break it down for you. In this post, we’ll explain what is a domain name and how does it work so that it’s easy to understand. Let’s get started. </p>\n<h3>What is a Domain Name?</h3>\n<p>So, what is a domain name? The simplest way to put it is: If your website is a house, a domain name is your address. A domain name is the address people type into the browser URL bar to get to your website. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_323405003.jpg\" alt=\"what-is-a-domain-name\" width=\"740\" height=\"317\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228669\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_323405003.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/shutterstock_323405003-300x129.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Some examples of domain names include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>IsItWP.com</li>\n<li>Google.com</li>\n<li>Facebook.com</li>\n<li>Wikipedia.org</li>\n<li>Yahoo.com</li>\n<li>Whitehouse.gov</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For a more technical explanation of what a domain name is: The internet is a giant network of computers that are connected through a network of cables. Every computer is assigned a unique IP address that allows the computers to communicate with each other. The IP address is a series of numbers that is used to identify each particular computer. A typical IP address looks like this: </p>\n<p>192.168.1.1</p>\n<p>An IP address is difficult to remember, so domain names were invented to solve that problem. Instead of having to type in a string of random numbers that’s difficult to remember, users only have to type in a domain name, like PizzaDelivery.com, in order to visit a website. </p>\n<p>Now that you know what a domain name is, let’s talk about how domain names work. </p>\n<p>When a user types a domain name into the URL bar of an internet browser, it sends a request to the Domain Name System (DNS), which is a global network of servers. When these servers receive your request, they search for the name servers that are associated with the domain name and forward the request to those name servers. </p>\n<p>Your website hosting company manages your name servers. So, if your website is hosted on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a>, Bluehost will then forward the request to the computer where your website files are stored. This computer is called the web server. The web server then gathers the requested website and sends it back to the browser so the user can view it. </p>\n<h3>The Different Parts of a Domain Name</h3>\n<p>There are 3 different parts to a domain name, they are as follows:</p>\n<p><strong>1. Subdomain</strong></p>\n<p>The first part of a domain name (from left to right) is the www part that comes before the dot. </p>\n<p>Example: <strong>www</strong>.IsItWP.com</p>\n<p>This is a standard part for every domain name, called the machine name or subdomain. This is optional though, because you don’t need to enter www before a domain name in a browser in order to visit that domain. You domain name can just be IsItWP.com.   </p>\n<p><strong>2. Second Level Domain</strong><br />\nThe second part is the second level domain, which is the part you’re most familiar with, between the dots. </p>\n<p>Example: www.<strong>IsItWP</strong>.com</p>\n<p>This is your domain name itself that you register for and it’s the most customizable part. </p>\n<p><strong>3. Top Level Domain</strong><br />\nAt the very end of the domain name, after the dot, is the top level domain also known as the domain extension. </p>\n<p>Example: www.IsItWP<strong>.com</strong></p>\n<p>The domain extension can be .com, .biz, .net, .org, .gov, as well as many other variations. But .com is the most popular and well known. </p>\n<h3>Why Do You Need a Domain Name?</h3>\n<p>Are you still wondering why you need a domain name? Well, if you want to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\">make your own website</a>, you’ll need a domain name so that other people can visit your website from their computers. </p>\n<p>People want to start websites for a number of different reasons, which is why there are millions of register domain names. It’s becoming more common today for people to have personal websites, for personal or promotional reasons, so many people register their name as a domain name. For instance, if your name is Catherine Smith, you might want to register the domain name CatherineSmith.com. That way when someone searches your name online, you’ll be easily found. </p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/amazing-blogging-stats-facts/\">popularity of blogging</a> has also led to more people registering domain names for a hobby or to make money. </p>\n<p>Plus, if you want to start a business, you need a website with its own unique domain name. Having a website for your business today is as necessary as having a phone number or FAX number in the past. You need a website so that your customers can get in touch with you online and browse your products and services from the comfort of their own homes. Your website needs a memorable domain name, typically that matches your business name, so people can easily find you online. Furthermore, you’ll want to register a domain name for your business to protect your name from being taken by your competitors. </p>\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a Domain Name and URL?</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/URL-domain-name-difference.jpg\" alt=\"difference-between-domain-name-url\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228672\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/URL-domain-name-difference.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/URL-domain-name-difference-300x142.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Though they might look almost the same, a domain name and URL are 2 different things. The domain name is the actual name of the website like IsItWP.com, whereas a URL is the entire path of a website that leads you to a particular page like https://www.isitwp.com/blog/. Basically, the URL is the complete internet address used to locate a specific page and it includes the domain name.  </p>\n<p>The URL (Uniform Resource Locator) instructs your browser exactly where to go using a specific protocol which is most commonly the http or https part of a URL. Then the last part of the URL directs your browser on which page of a website to go to, like the blog page. </p>\n<h3>What is the Difference Between a Domain Name and Website Hosting?</h3>\n<p>Just because you register a domain name doesn’t mean you automatically get a website. The domain name is the address of your website and your website hosting is the home where your website lives. If you don’t have a home for your website, your address leads to nowhere. So, you need a domain name and web hosting to create a functioning website. </p>\n<p>The home where your website lives is the actual computer where your website files are stored. These servers are offered as a service by <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/hosting-reviews/\">website hosting companies</a>. When you purchase website hosting you’ll get access to these servers to store your website. Once you have built a website on a web host and registered a domain name, your site will be able to be seen by people on the web. </p>\n<p>Many website hosting companies allow you to register and purchase a domain name too, like Bluehost for instance, so you can easily manage your domain name and your entire website from the same account. </p>\n<p>Check out our other post on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/difference-between-domain-name-and-web-hosting-revealed/\">the difference between a domain name and web hosting</a> for a more in-depth explanation. </p>\n<h3>How to Choose a Good Domain Name</h3>\n<p>Choosing the right domain name for your website is important. It’s not a decision you should make hastily, you need to really think about it and come up with a domain name that’s unique, memorable, and one that works for your website. </p>\n<p>There are a number of tips you should remember when choosing a domain name including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep it Short</strong> &#8211; Don’t make your domain too long, it will be harder for people to remember and more difficult to spell. Spelling errors can cause your website a loss of traffic.</li>\n<li><strong>Stick with .com</strong> &#8211; The domain extension .com is the most popular and trusted, so stick with it.</li>\n<li><strong>Use Keywords</strong> &#8211; Keywords will help search engines determine what your website is all about and make it easier for users to find you online. So if you’re a photography website, use the keyword “photography” in your domain name.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid Numbers and Hyphens</strong> &#8211; Numbers can lead to misspellings of your domain name, like “five” instead of “5”. And hyphens are often used by spam sites, which you don’t want to be associated with.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you want to learn more about how to choose a domain name for your website, check out our post on How to Pick the Best Domain Name. </p>\n<h3>How to Get a Domain Name</h3>\n<p>Getting your own domain name isn’t difficult. You can register and purchase a domain name from many different companies. Typically a domain name costs around $14.99/year from popular companies like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/godaddy-hosting/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >GoDaddy.com</a> and <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/namecheap/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Namecheap.com</a>. </p>\n<p>But just because you purchase a domain name doesn’t mean you get a website, you need website hosting for that.

You can use WordPress to get more traffic on your blog. It comes with thousands of plugins and themes to customize your blog as you need.</p>\n<p>There&#8217;re 2 types of WordPress websites which may confuse beginners. You&#8217;ll find WordPress.com, which is a hosted platform; and WordPress.org, which is a self-hosted solution.

You’ll be able to create eye-catching, highly converting optin forms without having to touch a single line of code. It also works with all the most popular <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-email-marketing-services-compared/\" title=\"9 Best Email Marketing Services Compared\">email marketing services</a>.</p>\n<p>OptinMonster’s one-of-a-kind Exit-Intent® Technology, along with its Geo-Location Targeting tools, make it truly unique.</p>\n<p><strong>Thrive Leads</strong></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thrive-leads-wordpress-plugin.jpg\" alt=\"thrive-leads-wordpress--plugin\" width=\"745\" height=\"288\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-220349\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thrive-leads-wordpress-plugin.jpg 745w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/thrive-leads-wordpress-plugin-300x116.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" /></p>\n<p>Thrive Themes launched in 2013 and took the internet by storm, becoming one of the most popular WordPress themes marketplaces available. Shortly after, in 2015, Thrive Themes got into the plugin game with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a>.</p>\n<p>With over 79,000 installs, Thrive Leads is making waves in the content marketing world.</p>\n<p>As a WordPress theme building company, it’s not surprising that Thrive Leads would include numerous beautiful pre-built templates to choose from. Nor is it a surprise that the Thrive Leads plugin works so well with WordPress websites.</p>\n<h3>Website Supported: OptinMonster vs. Thrive Leads</h3>\n<p><strong>OptinMonster</strong></p>\n<p>As a standalone solution, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> works with any type of website. </p>\n<p>While OptinMonster does have a connector plugin available to integrate it perfectly with WordPress sites, you can also use it on Squarespace, Blogger, Shopify, Magento, an HTML website, or any other platform.</p>\n<p>In order to access OptinMonster’s features, simply log into your account on their website and build your optin forms from your user dashboard. Since OptinMonster is a standalone app that’s accessed through its own website, you’ll never have to worry about taking up bandwidth on your own site. You also won’t have to worry about relying on the speed of your web hosting provider slowing down your campaigns. OptinMonster is always speedy and reliable.</p>\n<p>In addition, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> offers automatic cloud backups for your data as well as the ability to manage multiple website campaigns from one location.</p>\n<p><strong>Thrive Leads</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a> is a WordPress plugin. In other words, Thrive Leads was built exclusively for <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\" title=\"How to Make a Website in 2019- Step by Step (with Pictures)\">WordPress websites</a> and you must own a website built with WordPress in order for it to work. It cannot be used on any other website platforms.</p>\n<p>All of your settings are configured on your WordPress website when using Thrive Leads. And any leads you obtain, along with your analytics and additional data are stored on your WordPress website as well.</p>\n<p>You’ll also be responsible for your own backups and security as <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a> does nothing to protect you from data loss.</p>\n<p>When it comes to comparing OptinMonster vs. Thrive Leads, website support is one of the biggest issues that stands out. Thrive Leads is a fantastic WordPress plugin; however, it’s limited when compared to OptinMonster’s incredible flexibility.</p>\n<h3>Ease of Use: OptinMonster vs. Thrive Leads</h3>\n<p><strong>OptinMonster</strong></p>\n<p>Since the magic of <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> all occurs on the official OptinMonster website, all you need to to is head over to app.optinmonster.com and enter in your login details to begin. You&#8217;ll then be taken to your dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Dashboard.png\" alt=\"OptinMonster Dashboard\" width=\"775\" height=\"336\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228719\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Dashboard.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Dashboard-300x130.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Dashboard-768x333.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>From there, simply click the big green &#8220;Create Campaign&#8221; button in the upper right-hand corner, and you&#8217;ll be well on your way. Simply choose the type of campaign you&#8217;d like to build on the next screen:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Create-Campaign.png\" alt=\"OptinMonster Create Campaign\" width=\"775\" height=\"256\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228720\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Create-Campaign.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Create-Campaign-300x99.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Create-Campaign-768x254.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>And then choose a template:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Choose-Template.png\" alt=\"OptinMonster Choose Template\" width=\"595\" height=\"330\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228721\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Choose-Template.png 595w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Choose-Template-300x166.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 595px) 100vw, 595px\" /></p>\n<p>Once that&#8217;s all taken care of, you&#8217;ll be taken to the easy-to-use drag and drop builder:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Builder.png\" alt=\"OptinMonster Builder\" width=\"775\" height=\"349\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228722\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Builder.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Builder-300x135.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/OptinMonster-Builder-768x346.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Simply click on the elements you&#8217;d like to edit within your chosen template, or drag and drop new element blocks onto your campaign from the left-hand side. It couldn&#8217;t be simpler! OptinMonster&#8217;s intuitive interface is so easy to understand, even an absolute beginner can create a fresh marketing campaign with ease.</p>\n<p>Across the top of the screen, you&#8217;ll see blue tabs that&#8217;ll help guide you through the complete process, from building to integration to publication. Although the interface is nice and tidy, nothing is hidden. You&#8217;ll never find yourself fumbling or lost, trying desperately to figure out what to do next. Everything is laid out for you in the most efficient, user-friendly way possible.</p>\n<p><strong>Thrive Leads</strong></p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a> is a WordPress-exclusive plugin, you&#8217;ll first need to install and activate it on your WordPress website before you can begin. If you need help, check out our guide on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/install-wordpress-plugin/\" title=\"How to Install a WordPress Plugin\">how to install a plugin</a>.</p>\n<p>After that&#8217;s taken care of, you&#8217;ll need to enter in your license key (from your Thrive Leads account) by clicking on the Thrive Leads tab on the left-hand side of your WordPress dashboard. Once you&#8217;ve done that, click the Thrive Leads tab will now open your Thrive Leads dashboard:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Dashboard.png\" alt=\"Thrive Leads Dashboard\" width=\"775\" height=\"271\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228724\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Dashboard.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Dashboard-300x105.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Dashboard-768x269.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>Right off the bat, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a> can feel pretty overwhelming, especially to beginners. You&#8217;ll be presented with numerous &#8220;Add New&#8221; buttons with little-to-no explanation as to what they actually do:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Menu.png\" alt=\"Thrive Leads Menu\" width=\"445\" height=\"360\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228726\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Menu.png 445w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Menu-300x243.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 445px) 100vw, 445px\" /></p>\n<p>Chances are, in order to use this plugin effectively, you&#8217;ll need to spend a good deal of time reading their documentation, looking up tutorial articles online, or even browsing YouTube how-to videos. It&#8217;s got quite a steep learning curve, especially in comparison to OptinMonster. However, we&#8217;ll do our best to give you the gist of the process here.</p>\n<p>Before you can get started, you&#8217;ll need to add a Lead Group. Once you have a Lead Group set up, then, and only then, can you take action to begin building a proper campaign.</p>\n<p>For our test, we selected the ThriveBoxes (Thrive Leads&#8217; version of a lightbox) option underneath our Lead Group. This menu popped up:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Create-Form.png\" alt=\"Thrive Leads Create Form\" width=\"745\" height=\"374\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228728\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Create-Form.png 745w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Create-Form-300x151.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 745px) 100vw, 745px\" /></p>\n<p>From there, it feels a tad simpler. Choose the type of popup you&#8217;d like to create, pick a template, and you&#8217;re on your way. But then the builder looks like this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Builder.png\" alt=\"Thrive Leads Builder\" width=\"775\" height=\"345\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228729\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Builder.png 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Builder-300x134.png 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Thrive-Leads-Builder-768x342.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></p>\n<p>As you can see, everything is tucked away and hidden from the user. You&#8217;ll have to spend a great deal of time poking around on your form in order to find everything you need to make it work properly. The actual builder is fairly simple thanks to the drag and drop feature; however, getting it to actually behave properly can take a lot of needless tweaking.</p>\n<p>In the end, the final product (popup) produced by the Thrive Leads plugin is top notch. But at what cost? Time is money and you&#8217;ll waste a lot of time attempting to learn Thrive Leads. When it comes to ease of use regarding OptinMonster vs Thrive Leads, OptinMonster is the clear winner. </p>\n<h3>Pricing Comparison</h3>\n<p>To use <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> on 1 website, you can choose the Basic plan at $9/month. For use on 2 websites, as well as additional premium features, the Plus plan is available for $19/month. Their most popular plan, Pro, includes every feature available for 3 websites and costs $29/month. Or, if you have larger needs, you can subscribe to the Growth plan at $49/month.</p>\n<p>Thrive Leads offers various license options, starting at $67 for 1 site license. The other 2 license plans are $97 for 5 site licenses, or $147 for 15 licenses. </p>\n<p>Alternatively, you can opt to become a Thrive Themes member for $228/year. Doing so gives you access to all of Thrive Themes’ WordPress themes and available plugins, including Thrive Leads; and 25 site licenses.</p>\n<h3>Documentation and Support</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a> includes 1 year of technical support with any license plan you buy. Additional years of support can be purchased for $40/year.</p>\n<p>The Thrive Themes team has also put together several video tutorials and blog posts to help new users find their way around the Thrive Leads plugin.</p>\n<p>As for OptinMonster, all subscribers, regardless of their plan, have access to their ticket-based support system at no additional charge. </p>\n<p>Users also have access to over 200 articles covering everything anyone could ever want to know about how to successfully use OptinMonster.</p>\n<p>In addition, Pro and Growth members have access to priority support at no extra charge.</p>\n<h3>OptinMonster vs. Thrive Leads: Who Wins? </h3>\n<p>In the end, the choice is entirely up to you. Both <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a> and <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/thriveleads/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Thrive Leads</a> are quality products that do exactly what they claim to. </p>\n<p>Personally, we prefer OptinMonster for its ease-of-use, killer customer service, and unbeatable prices. Plus, the fact that this standalone app can be utilized with any type of website gives us exactly the power and flexibility we desire most.</p>\n<p>Of course, if you’re purely a WordPress user and you don’t mind tackling a steeper learning curve, Thrive Leads could work well for you. For what it is, the pricing options can be a bit expensive; however, if you’re interested in any of Thrive Themes’ other products (themes, plugins, etc.) in addition to Thrive Leads, then their membership bundle is definitely worth considering.</p>\n<p>Whichever you end up choosing, we hope you’ll tell us about it in the comments. </p>\n<p>We also hope this article helped you make a confident, informed decision.</p>\n<p>If you found this article useful, you might also enjoy our tutorial on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/create-content-upgrade/\" title=\"How to Create a High-Conversion Content Upgrade (Easy Way)\">how to create a content upgrade</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/optinmonster-vs-thrive-leads/\">Thrive Leads Alternatives: OptinMonster vs. Thrive Leads</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.isitwp.com\">IsItWP - WordPress Technology Lookup Tool</a>.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:36:\"http://wellformedweb.org/CommentAPI/\";a:1:{s:10:\"commentRss\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:57:\"https://www.isitwp.com/optinmonster-vs-thrive-leads/feed/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:38:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/slash/\";a:1:{s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1:\"0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n		\n		\n				\n			\n		\n		\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:5:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:59:\"WordPress Alternatives – 18 Popular WordPress Competitors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-alternatives-popular-wordpress-competitors/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"comments\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-alternatives-popular-wordpress-competitors/#respond\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 29 Jan 2019 11:25:35 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Resources\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:17:\"compare wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"popular wordpress competitors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"wordpress alternatives\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21:\"wordpress competitors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://www.isitwp.com/?p=228278\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:670:\"<p>Are you looking for an alternative to WordPress?

With just a few clicks, you can easily turn your homepage into static a page and add a separate blog page to your WordPress site.</p>\n<p>In this step-by-step tutorial, we’ll show you how to create a separate blog page in WordPress with ease.</p>\n<h3>1. Create 2 Pages &#8211; a Blog Page and a Homepage</h3>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is create 2 pages for your blog and your homepage. In your WordPress dashboard, navigate to Pages &raquo; Add New. For the sake of this example, we&#8217;ll name the pages Blog and Home. Then, publish those pages.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create-a-new-page-home.png\" alt=\"create a new page - home\" width=\"604\" height=\"230\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228677\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create-a-new-page-home.png 604w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/create-a-new-page-home-300x114.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 604px) 100vw, 604px\" /></p>\n<p>Be sure to add the necessary content to your home page before publishing it.</p>\n<h3>2. Choose the Right Page Templates</h3>\n<p>WordPress themes are shipped with several page templates to help you quickly customize the look of your pages. Check whether your theme comes with homepage and blog page templates. </p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t find an appropriate template, then head to the next step.</p>\n<p>Here’s how to choose the right template for your WordPress page:</p>\n<p>In the <strong>Page Attributes</strong> meta box, choose the template you want from the Template dropdown and update your page.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onepress-review-frontpage-template.png\" alt=\"frontpage template\" width=\"290\" height=\"335\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1819\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onepress-review-frontpage-template.png 290w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onepress-review-frontpage-template-260x300.png 260w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 290px) 100vw, 290px\" /></p>\n<h3>3. Configure Homepage Settings</h3>\n<p>Head over to <strong>Settings &raquo; Reading</strong>. Next to the <strong>Your homepage displays</strong> option, choose <strong>A static page</strong>.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onepress-review-frontpage.png\" alt=\"OnePress Review - set up frontpage\" width=\"560\" height=\"180\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1820\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onepress-review-frontpage.png 560w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/onepress-review-frontpage-300x96.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 560px) 100vw, 560px\" /></p>\n<p>You’ll now be prompted to choose a homepage and a posts page. After selecting the pages you made (ex: Home and Blog), click <strong>Save Changes</strong>.</p>\n<h3>4. Add the Blog Page to Your Menu</h3>\n<p>Now that you’ve created a separate blog page and homepage, the next thing we recommend doing is adding your blog page and homepage to your navigation menu.</p>\n<p>Your site&#8217;s navigation menu provides quick access to some of the most important pages of your site. To add, edit, or manage your navigation menu, go to Appearance &raquo; Menus.

There’s no shame in it, the internet can be a confusing place for beginners and we all have to start somewhere. Fortunately, we’re here to help guide you through the world wide web and explain what a blog is and the differences between a blog and a website.  </p>\n<p>So, if you think about starting a blog or website, after reading this beginner’s guide you’ll be one step closer to becoming an expert on the subject. </p>\n<p>Let’s get started!</p>\n<h3>What is a Blog?</h3>\n<p>A blog is a type of website where the content is presented in chronological order, typically with newer content appearing first followed by older content. The content on blogs is also known as blog posts or blog entries. A blog post is your piece of writing, or it could include another format of content like photos, videos, etc. </p>\n<p>Blogs are usually run by 1 person or a small group of people and the information is presented in a less formal, more conversational way. Blogs also have comment sections where users can respond to particular blog posts.  </p>\n<p>In the early days of blogging, a blog was used by most people as a sort of personal diary. Bloggers would share their thoughts, details about their day-to-day lives, and personal photos. Back then, users were building and running their own personal web pages in order to blog. But once the popularity of blogging began to grow, a number of companies started to take advantage of the new trend. </p>\n<p>In 1999, Blogger (which was later acquired by Google, LiveJournal, and Xanga all launched as platforms for bloggers. Then, in 2003, WordPress released its first version as a blogging platform. <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress</a> today is the most <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-blogging-platforms-beginners-compared/\">popular online blogging platform</a> and actually powers 30% of the internet. </p>\n<p>But blogging today has completely evolved. Bloggers now blog for a number of different reasons and on numerous different subjects/niches. For instance, here is a list of just a few popular blogging niches:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lifestyle</li>\n<li>Parenting</li>\n<li>Health/Fitness</li>\n<li>Food/Cooking</li>\n<li>Personal Finance</li>\n<li>Beauty</li>\n<li>Travel</li>\n<li>Tech</li>\n<li>Entrepreneurship</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As you can see, you can <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/50-blog-post-ideas-that-you-can-write-about-today/\" target=\"_blank\">write a blog</a> on pretty much any subject you want.</p>\n<p>To give you a visual, here are some examples of popular blogs online:</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.bustle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bustle</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bustle-1.jpg\" alt=\"bustle-blog\" width=\"740\" height=\"392\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228390\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bustle-1.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bustle-1-300x159.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><br />\nBustle was launched in 2013 and focuses on topics for millennial women such as beauty, fashion, celebrities, and even politics. They have nearly 80 million readers tuning in monthly. </p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://pinchofyum.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Pinch of Yum</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pinch-of-yum.jpg\" alt=\"pinch-of-yum-food-blog\" width=\"740\" height=\"408\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228391\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pinch-of-yum.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/pinch-of-yum-300x165.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><br />\nThis next one is Pinch of Yum, a popular food blog featuring thousands of delicious and easy to cook recipes. The owner of the blog, Lindsay, was formerly a high school teacher but was able to turn blogging into a full-time career.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://www.danflyingsolo.com/travel-blog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Dan Flying Solo</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dan-flying-solo.jpg\" alt=\"dan-flying-solo-travel-blog\" width=\"740\" height=\"367\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228392\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dan-flying-solo.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/dan-flying-solo-300x149.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><br />\nOne of the top travel blogs on the web is Dan Flying Solo. Dan documents his travels around the world and gives tips and advice to aspiring adventurers. </p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://cupofjo.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Cup of Joe</a></h4>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cup-of-joe-blog.jpg\" alt=\"a-cup-of-joe-blog\" width=\"740\" height=\"377\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228393\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cup-of-joe-blog.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/cup-of-joe-blog-300x153.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><br />\nA Cup of Joe is well-known mommy blog, owned by Joanna. The blog started out as a hobby to share parenting and lifestyle advice but due to its success, Joanna was able to turn the blog into her full-time job.  </p>\n<h3>What is a Website?</h3>\n<p>Now, what’s the difference between a blog and a website? Although blogs are a type of website, a typical website is unchanging. It has a number of interlinked static pages where related content is organized and it’s not frequently updated. Normally websites have a home page, an about page, a services/products page, and a contact page, but you have the ability to create any page you want. Websites are usually created to present information about a business and they’re less interactive and more of a one-way communication. </p>\n<p>Today, every business is expected to have a website. It’s a way to provide information to potential customers and also a place for customers to purchase their products or services online. With <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-website-builders-for-beginners-compared/\" title=\"10 Best Website Builders for Beginners Compared (2019)\">website builders</a> in the market, it&#8217;s become simple to create a website even when you have no knowledge of code.</p>\n<p>Here are some examples of what a typical website looks like:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/awesomemotive.jpg\" alt=\"awesome-motive-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"384\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228394\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/awesomemotive.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/awesomemotive-300x156.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><br />\nAs you can see, the website of <a href=\"https://awesomemotive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Motive</a>, the management company behind IsItWP and WPBeginner, has a clean design and only a few pages featured in the menu at the top to show information about the business, no blog. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/panera-bread.jpg\" alt=\"restaurant-website\" width=\"740\" height=\"351\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228395\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/panera-bread.jpg 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/panera-bread-300x142.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /><br />\nAnother example is this one from the restaurant chain <a href=\"https://www.panera.ca/en-us/home.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Panera Bread</a>. They have pages in their menu at the top of their home page to provide information to their customers about the locations of their restaurants and info about their catering service, no blog on this website either. </p>\n<h3>Blog vs. Website: What Should You Choose?</h3>\n<p>If you’re thinking about starting a blog or a website and you don’t know which one to choose, let’s break it down so you can figure it out. Whether you choose a blog or a website depends on your goals and what you want to accomplish. There are a number of reasons why people start blogging, here are just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To organize their thoughts and feelings.</li>\n<li>Share their opinions on a topic or number of topics.</li>\n<li>Connect with like-minded people.</li>\n<li>Share their creativity or expertise on a subject.</li>\n<li>To help others.</li>\n<li>Make a little extra income.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If your goal is related to any one of these reasons and you have a lot of fresh information you want to share with the world, then a blog is probably a good choice for you. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you’re already running a business that sells products/services or you want to start one, then you should choose a website. Your future customers need to be able to find your business and information about it on the web, and the best way to make that happen is by making a website. </p>\n<p>If you’ve decided to build a website and want a detailed guide on how to do it, take a look at our post on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-make-a-website-step-by-step/\">How to Make a Website &#8211; Step by Step</a>. </p>\n<h3>Can You Have Both a Blog and a Website in One?</h3>\n<p>There’s also no reason why you can’t have a blog and a website in one.

Many people start a blog as a hobby and just do it for the love of writing and sharing their thoughts with others. But you can actually make money blogging too. If you know <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/legit-ways-to-make-money-online-blogging/\">how to make money online</a> with blogging, you could even quit your day job and turn your blog into a money-making business. </p>\n<p>One of the easiest ways to make money blogging is by displaying ads on your blog with Google Adsense. Google Adsense is a free to use and takes care of all of your ads for you. They’ll find the right ads for your blog, display them, collect payment from the advertisers, and send you the payments after taking a small cut. The more clicks the ads get on your blog, the more you get paid. </p>\n<p>Another popular way for bloggers to make money is to <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-plugins-for-affiliate-marketers/\">participate in affiliate marketing</a>. Affiliate marketing is where you talk about, recommend, or review a product in your blog posts and provide a link for your readers to buy those products. The link is tracked and you get a commission anytime someone purchases the product through clicking your link.  </p>\n<p>Many bloggers also sell digital products like eBooks, guides, or templates. You can also turn your blog into a membership site which readers have to pay to get access to. Another option is to sell online courses and webinars. As you can see, blogging doesn’t have to be just a hobby for you, you can actually turn it into a business. </p>\n<h3>How to Start a Blog</h3>\n<p>Today it’s <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-start-a-blog-step-by-step/\">easier than ever to start a blog</a> and anyone can do it &#8211; even beginners.

What’s the catch? Why is this free? There must be something wrong with it if they’re giving it away! So, if you’re asking yourself why is WordPress free, you’re not alone. </p>\n<p>But we’re here to tell you that, in fact, WordPress is a free and open source software. In this article, we’ll explain why WordPress is free, go over the costs of running a WordPress site, and uncover any hidden catches. </p>\n<p>Let’s get started.  </p>\n<h3>Why is WordPress Free?</h3>\n<p>So, yes, WordPress is free to download and use. It’s an open source software that’s licensed under the <a href=\"http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">GNU General Public License agreement</a>, anyone can use it, modify it, and share it because its design is publicly accessible. Since its design and source code are openly shared, WordPress users are encouraged to voluntarily improve the design of the software. Users can also report bugs, contribute patches, and suggest features for improvement. </p>\n<p>The main philosophy behind free and open source software is freedom. The creators believe that everyone deserves the freedom to control the program and what it does for them. When you use a paid software, the program controls the user and the developer controls the program. </p>\n<p>Many people also believe that software is not a tangible product. Once a software is created, it can be copied over and over again with very little cost involved. So, if there’s no actual cost to recreate the software, why should there be a cost to acquire and use it? Take Wikipedia for example, it’s a free online encyclopedia that’s created and edited by volunteers around the world, so there’s no cost to use it. </p>\n<p>So, why is WordPress free? Basically it all boils down to the fact that WordPress is not owned by any 1 person, rather it’s an open source community project where thousands of people contribute to it to make it what it is today. </p>\n<h3>WordPress.org vs. WordPress.com: Are They Both Free?</h3>\n<p>It’s important to note that there are 2 different types of WordPress: WordPress.org and WordPress.com. WordPress.org is an open source software that’s free to download and use any way you wish. It’s a self-hosted solution, which means you download the software and use it on your own domain. </p>\n<p>On the other hand, WordPress.com is a freemium website and blog hosting service. You can start a website for free with WordPress.com but it’s very limited. Unlike with WordPress.org, with a free WordPress.com website you don’t get your own custom domain name, your design customization abilities are limited, and you aren’t allowed to download any WordPress plugins. You’re also not allowed to monetize your free WordPress.com website; this means no direct ads or Adsense and no affiliate marketing. </p>\n<p>If you do want access to any of those features, it’s going to cost you quite a bit. Depending on your needs, you’ll have to pay anywhere from $36 &#8211; $300 per year and they also offer a VIP plan starting at an astounding $5000 per month. </p>\n<p>For a more detailed look at the differences between WordPress.org and WordPress.com, check out our post titled <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-one-really-better/\">WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org &#8211; Is One Really Better Than the Other?</a></p>\n<h3>How Does WordPress Make Money?</h3>\n<p>Now you might be wondering how WordPress can keep running if it’s free. After all, the WordPress team still needs to cover the costs of some things like web hosting and hardware. So, if WordPress is free, how does it make money? </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-wordpress-makes-money.png\" alt=\"how wordpress makes money\" width=\"740\" height=\"392\" class=\"alignright size-full wp-image-228450\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-wordpress-makes-money.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/how-wordpress-makes-money-300x159.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Well, the co-founder of WordPress, Matt Mullenweg, owns a company called Automattic. Automattic offers a number of freemium blogging services, including WordPress.com, which we mentioned earlier. The company also owns popular freemium WordPress plugins like Jetpack and Akismet.</p>\n<p>As we stated before, WordPress.com is a freemium website hosting service. Users can start a blog or website for free but to unlock a number of powerful and useful features like plugins, users have to pay for it. This income allows WordPress.com to contribute to and support WordPress.org. With the profits the company Automattic earns, they can afford to keep WordPress.org running and free for everyone. </p>\n<h3>Can You Make Money from WordPress?</h3>\n<p>Another popular question from WordPress beginners is “Can I make money with WordPress?” Typically when you get something for free, you can’t make money off of it. But with WordPress, you actually can make money. There are 2 main ways you can make money with WordPress or any other open source software which is by creating products or services based on that open source software. </p>\n<p>There are a number of WordPress users who’ve gone on to create successful companies based on amazing WordPress products, plugins, themes, and even WordPress hosting solutions. Some notable multi-million dollar WordPress companies, besides Automattic, include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/elegant-themes/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Elegant Themes</a> &#8211; A premium themes and plugin company behind Divi, the most <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/best-wordpress-page-builders-compared/\">popular drag and drop page builder plugins</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://awesomemotive.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Awesome Motive</a> &#8211; A multi-million dollar WordPress company led by <a href=\"https://syedbalkhi.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Syed Balkhi</a>. They’re behind companies such as <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPBeginner</a>, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OptinMonster</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/\" target=\"_blank\">WPForms</a>, <a href=\"https://www.monsterinsights.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MonsterInsights</a>, and more.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/sucuri/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sucuri</a> &#8211; One of the most popular WordPress security solutions in the market.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/wpengine/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WPEngine</a> &#8211; One of the most popular managed hosting solutions for WordPress.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://yoast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yoast</a> &#8211; Their plugin Yoast SEO is one of the most popular WordPress plugins of all time.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You don’t have to create a product to make money from WordPress either. There are a number of other ways to make a living with WordPress including as a WordPress developer, building custom WordPress websites, managing enterprise-level WordPress sites, <a href=\"https://optinmonster.com/ultimate-seo-guide/\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress SEO</a> specialist, and more. And of course, you can use your WordPress site to sell any type of product or service you want. </p>\n<h3>Are There Hidden Legal Terms for WordPress?</h3>\n<p>Now, we said that WordPress is free and you can do whatever you want with it, but are there any catches like hidden legal terms? While you are able to do just about anything with WordPress, there are a few things you need to keep in mind. </p>\n<p>First, the WordPress trademark. WordPress as a software is released under GPL but the words WordPress and WordCamp, as well as the WordPress logo, are all trademarks owned by the WordPress foundation. So, for instance, if you want to start a WordPress based company by selling products or services, you’re not allowed to use the word “WordPress” in your domain because it’s against their trademark policy. You can however, use “WP” in your domain, which is what many successful WordPress based companies do. If you want to use the WordPress logo on your website, make sure you use it in accordance with <a href=\"http://wordpressfoundation.org/trademark-policy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">WordPress trademark policy</a>. </p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wordpress-logo-trademark.png\" alt=\"wordpress-logo-trademark\" width=\"740\" height=\"545\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228329\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wordpress-logo-trademark.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wordpress-logo-trademark-300x221.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></p>\n<p>Secondly, we need to talk about copyright. Many users have wondered whether WordPress is copyright free. The simple answer to that is no. WordPress is licensed under the GPL, which means that you can use, modify, and redistribute the code as you like, but you don’t have the copyright to the entire code. You will only have the copyright to the modifications you make to the software. </p>\n<p>Also any work you release derived from a software released under GPL needs to be licensed under GPL as well. Which means that anyone else is free to use, modify, and redistribute your code in any way they choose too. For example, WordPress themes are released under GPL. The CSS, javascript, images, used inside a theme are excluded but all the PHP and HTML parts of a theme that are derived from WordPress functionality are licensed under the GPL. </p>\n<h3>Can I Start a WordPress Website for Free?</h3>\n<p>Now if you’re here, you’re probably wondering if you can start a WordPress site for free. While WordPress is free, there are some <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-much-does-it-cost-to-build-a-website-expert-answer/\" target=\"_blank\">costs to starting a WordPress website</a>. To use WordPress on the web, you need WordPress hosting and a domain. Hosting is where your website lives on the internet and what makes it possible for people to access your site via the web. </p>\n<p>Since all you need is a domain and hosting for your WordPress site, the cost is pretty minimal. But there are hosting solutions out there that are more expensive and you should avoid them especially if you’re just starting out. That’s why we recommend you choose <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" >Bluehost</a> as your hosting solution. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\" data-nojs=\"true\" ><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer.png\" alt=\"bluehost-wordpress-hosting\" width=\"740\" height=\"404\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-228328\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-refer-300x164.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bluehost is offering our readers an awesome deal. You can get a free domain name, free SSL, and over 60% off on WordPress hosting. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"btn ltgreen light\">Click Here to Claim This Exclusive Bluehost Offer &raquo;</a></p>\n<p>Now it’s more affordable to start your own website with WordPress than ever before.

That’s why we recommend you build your website with WordPress.org. There are many benefits to using WordPress.org to make your site, here are just a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>No Restrictions</strong> &#8211; With WordPress.org you can build, customize, and grow your website any way you want to without restrictions. </li>\n<li><strong>Easy Customization</strong> &#8211; WordPress gives you access to thousands of free WordPress themes to easily give your website the exact look you want. </li>\n<li><strong>Added Power</strong> &#8211; WordPress allows you to download and install thousands of free plugins from the official WordPress Plugin Directory to enhance your website to the fullest.</li>\n<li><strong>Monetization</strong> &#8211; You can <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/legit-ways-to-make-money-online-blogging/\">make money from your blog or website</a> because WordPress allows for monetization. You can run ads on your WordPress site without permission from your hosting platform or having to share the profits with them.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Another benefit of creating a website with WordPress.org is that you own any of the content you upload to your site, whether it’s writing, images, products, and so on. On other free blogging sites like WordPress.com for instance, you don’t completely own your own content. WordPress.com has the right to delete, sell, or modify any of your content without having to provide any reason to you for it. </p>\n<p>When compared side by side, <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-one-really-better/\">WordPress.org is far superior to WordPress.com</a> or other hosting solutions. You have complete control to create the website of your dreams and it’s easy to do so with all of the extra features you get with WordPress.org. </p>\n<p>Now that you know all the details about why WordPress is free and all about any costs associated with it, we hope choosing the right platform for your website is an easy decision for you.

They provide a free website platform for users who&#8217;re okay with a Weebly subdomain like https://yourbusinesswebsite.weebly.com. </p>\n<p>If you want to start your website with a <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/how-to-register-a-domain-name/\">professional domain name</a>, you&#8217;ll need to subscribe to one of their premium plans. There’re 2 different pricing options for business sites and eCommerce sites in Weebly. The pricing plans for online stores are slightly higher than their website pricing plans. </p>\n<p>Here&#8217;re the pricing plans for eCommerce stores: </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/weebly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/weebly-pricing-online-store.jpg\" alt=\"weebly-pricing-online-store\" width=\"775\" height=\"453\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-227484\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/weebly-pricing-online-store.jpg 775w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/weebly-pricing-online-store-300x175.jpg 300w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/weebly-pricing-online-store-768x449.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 775px) 100vw, 775px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The basic Weebly plan for eCommerce sites is <strong>Pro</strong>. It costs $12 per month when paid annually. </p>\n<p>The medium priced plan is <strong>Business</strong> which costs $25 per month when billed annually.

It’s an amazing alternative to Weebly for creating websites. </p>\n<p>WordPress comes in 2 flavors known as <strong>WordPress.com</strong> and <strong>WordPress.org</strong>. WordPress.com is a fully hosted platform like <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/weebly/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Weebly</a> whereas WordPress.org is a self-hosted platform. To start a new website on the WordPress.org platform, you’ll need to buy a domain name and hosting and install WordPress yourself. For more details, check out our article on <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-com-vs-wordpress-org-one-really-better/\">WordPress.com vs. WordPress.org</a>. </p>\n<p>However, using self-hosted WordPress is rewarding in many ways. First, it gives you the ability to control your website data completely. Since you host your website on your own hosting account, you’ll have full control over your website resources and data. This is not the case when you’re hosting your site on cloud-based website builders like Weebly. </p>\n<p>Second, you have limited design and customization options with Weebly in comparison to WordPress. With WordPress, you&#8217;ll have easy access to thousands of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-themes/\">free and premium themes</a> in the official WordPress.org directory, theme marketplaces, and third-party theme companies. Whereas, with Weebly, you’re limited to around 100 official themes created by Weebly. </p>\n<p>In addition, there’re thousands of <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wordpress-plugins/\">free and premium plugins</a> for extending your WordPress site’s functionality. There’re dozens of plugins which do a similar job, and, due to the competition, there’re really amazing products available. On the other hand, Weebly has limited apps. </p>\n<p>With regard to pricing, the basic plan for a Weebly website costs $5 per month whereas you can start a WordPress website for just $2.75 per month with <a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bluehost</a>. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.isitwp.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\"><img src=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bluehost-wordpress.png\" alt=\"start-a-website-bluehost\" width=\"740\" height=\"419\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-225328\" srcset=\"https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bluehost-wordpress.png 740w, https://www.isitwp.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/bluehost-wordpress-300x170.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 740px) 100vw, 740px\" /></a></p>\n<p>If you’re ready to invest some time and effort, WordPress is a far better platform than Weebly.

With attendance numbers higher than most WordPress conferences and hundreds more views on the videos published afterwards, Gordon considered it a success and committed to organize another event this year.</p>\n<p>The next edition is set for July 11-13, 2019, and has been expanded to feature three free days of talks, workshops, and contribution focused on JavaScript and WordPress. The goal for the event&#8217;s contributor day is to improve Gutenberg documentation. Applications for speakers and sponsors are now open and attendees can reserve their seats by signing up on the event&#8217;s <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/conference/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The conference aims to cover intermediate and advanced topics (not so much beginner),&#8221; Gordon said. &#8220;Most of the talks are about latest trends of how JS and WP can be used together. Accessibility is really important, as is diversity in speakers. I&#8217;d love to have more folks share about cool things they do at work.&#8221; He said topics like headless WP, Gatsby, React, state management, Gutenberg, and blockchain are a few examples that seem to be popular in this space right now. Testing and internationalization are two topics that still need speakers.</p>\n<p>Gordon teaches both beginner and more advanced <a href=\"https://javascriptforwp.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">courses</a> on JavaScript and Gutenberg development, giving him a unique window into the landscape of JavaScript education. After Gutenberg made its way into core, Gordon said folks &#8220;finally have a tangible reason to learn JavaScript.&#8221; </p>\n<p>&#8220;Also, I think folks are finding it easier than first thought,&#8221; he said. &#8220;A lot of folks have taken my Gutenberg Development Course with zero React or tooling experience and that served as a good introduction to it all.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At first Matt said, &#8216;Learn JavaScript Deeply.&#8217; But at the last WCUS he said, &#8216;Learn Blocks Deeply.&#8217; Luckily, I think it is becoming easier to learn what we need to know with JS and React and tools to get by.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 03:39:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:62:\"WPTavern: WordCamp Nordic to Host Workshop for Kids on March 7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87229\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/wordcamp-nordic-to-host-workshop-for-kids-on-march-7\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4779:\"<a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/kids-workshop-belgrade.jpg?ssl=1\"><img /></a>photo credit: Ivan Gatić\n<p><a href=\"https://2019.nordic.wordcamp.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordCamp Nordic</a>, a new regional WordCamp taking place in Helsinki, is just 23 days away.

Topics include content design, entrepreneurship, security, leveraging AMP, WooCommerce, internationalization, Gutenberg, and general WordPress development.</p>\n<p>The event&#8217;s organizers are also embracing a growing trend of hosting a kids&#8217; camp alongside the WordCamp to introduce younger attendees to the software. WordCamp Nordic is planning a <a href=\"https://2019.nordic.wordcamp.org/contributor-day/wordpress-workshop-for-kids/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">free WordPress workshop for 20 kids</a> aged 8-14 that will be held Thursday, March 7, from 13:00 to 17:00. It will run at the same time and in the same venue as the WordCamp&#8217;s Contributor Day. Attendees will learn how to set up their own WordPress websites, choose a theme, and learn how to add text, galleries, videos, and other elements to the their sites.</p>\n<p>WordPress veteran Petya Raykovska is leading the kids&#8217; workshop. She has <a href=\"http://petya.in/wordpress-workshop-for-kids-an-organiser-kit/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">led similar workshops all over the world</a>, first in Bangkok 2017, followed by events in Belgrade, Sofia, Varna, and other locations. Demand for the kids&#8217; workshops has grown in the past two years and Raykovska started receiving requests from other European WordCamp organizers to lead events at their camps. As a result, she has created an <a href=\"https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/WordPress-Workshop-for-Kids-organiser-kit-kxmOjjycWysa3jFYoaBTv\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">organizer kit</a> for others wanting to host their own WordPress workshops for kids.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Thank you to all the kids workshop volunteers at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCSOF?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCSOF</a> and to all the kids who created their first <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WordPress?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WordPress</a> sites today.

Facebook (and soon to be Snapchat) is widely regarded as an &#8220;app for old people&#8221; and its <a href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/facebook-officially-old-people-803196\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">users under the age of 24 are rapidly declining</a>. WordPress is in a better position, because an influx of older users doesn&#8217;t affect the overall experience of the app the same way. However, if WordPress usage isn&#8217;t growing among the school age population, it is in danger of suffering the same fate as Facebook &#8211; becoming an application that will live and die with its current generation of users. Onboarding new young WordPressers doesn&#8217;t just help to ensure the software&#8217;s future but it also gives kids a tool that can help them find their place on the open web, a home for their content that will outlast all the ephemeral social networking apps. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 12 Feb 2019 23:38:52 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:2;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Blocks Design Library Offers Pre-Built Page Designs Using Existing Core Blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=87200\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:109:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-blocks-design-library-offers-pre-built-page-designs-using-existing-core-blocks\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2845:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/design/\">Gutenberg Blocks Design Library</a> is a new plugin that provides pre-built page designs, including demo content, using only the default core blocks that come with WordPress. The free version comes with 50 different designs that users can import from the growing Gutenberg Blocks Design Library. These include simple designs for all kinds of page building items, such as text with images, columns with headers, call-to-action sections, team member listings, testimonials, contact page layouts, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin is fully compatible with other Gutenberg themes and plugins, since it simply adds styles to existing core blocks. It can be used in combination with block collections, such as Atomic Blocks, Editor Blocks, CoBlocks, Caxton, Kadence, GhostKit, WooCommerce blocks, and many others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a few major advantages to this approach. Simply adding styles to core blocks means that the plugin doesn&#8217;t introduce a bunch of new blocks for users to scroll through in the block inserter. It also ensures data portability. If a user ends up deactivating and removing the plugin for any reason, the content is still there in the default block design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although Gutenberg Blocks Design Library is compatible with any WordPress theme that works with the new editor, the appearance of the the pre-made designs vary somewhat across themes. I tested various blocks with different themes and found that it seems to adapt to the active theme&#8217;s look and feel. This can be a positive feature or a negative one if the user is hoping for the designs to match the demo exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After installing the plugin, the design library is available by toggling the carrot icon in the menu at the top of the editor. The user is then prompted to import 50 free designs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The creators of the Gutenberg Blocks Design Library have also built a commercial subscription service to sell &#8220;<a href=\"https://wpdesignhub.com/pro/\">pro designs</a>.&#8221; Pricing during the beta period starts at $9/year for a single site.  The company aims to have 1,000 commercial designs available to subscribers by November 2019.

The organization has been instrumental in combatting issues caused by license proliferation, as many open source licenses cannot be legally combined and this can be detrimental to the open source ecosystem.</p>\n<p>The affirmation published this week explains the need for a standard definition of open source: </p>\n<blockquote><p>Without this single, standard definition of &#8220;open source,&#8221; software development as we know it would not be possible. There is no trust in a world where anyone can invent their own definition for open source, and without trust there is no community, no collaboration, and no innovation.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Recent controversy surrounding Redis Labs licensing some of its modules under the <a href=\"https://redislabs.com/community/commons-clause/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Apache 2.0 modified with a Commons Clause</a> has highlighted the need for an authoritative definition of open source. Salil Deshpande, who helped create the Commons Clause (written by open-source lawyer <a href=\"https://heathermeeker.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Heather Meeker</a>), wrote an <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/29/the-crusade-against-open-source-abuse/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">article</a> for TechCrunch two months ago about how he perceives large cloud infrastructure providers, such as AWS in this case, to be a threat to the viability of open source. He explained why he and collaborators commissioned the Commons Clause:</p>\n<blockquote><p>We wished to define a license that prevents cloud infrastructure providers from running certain software as a commercial service, while at the same time making that software effectively open source for everyone else, i.e. everyone not running that software as a commercial service.</p>\n<p>With our first proposal, Commons Clause, we took the most straightforward approach: we constructed one clause, which can be added to any liberal open-source license, preventing the licensee from “Selling” the software  —  where “Selling” includes running it as a commercial service. (Selling other software made with Commons Clause software is allowed, of course.) Applying Commons Clause transitions a project from open source to source-available.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In referencing MongoDB&#8217;s <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/licensing/server-side-public-license\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Server Side Public License (SSPL)</a>, Deshpande questioned the authority and relevance of OSI:</p>\n<blockquote><p>OSI, which has somehow anointed itself as the body that will “decide” whether a license is open source, has a habit of myopically debating what’s open source and what’s not. With the submission of SSPL to OSI, MongoDB has put the ball in OSI’s court to either step up and help solve an industry problem, or put their heads back in the sand.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The Commons Clause, which has no chance of being approved by OSI, was a reaction to cloud-based services making a profit from open source software without contributing much back to the software&#8217;s creators. This is a common issue encountered by maintainers of popular open source projects. However, the Commons Clause isn&#8217;t a good solution for this problem, because it effectively neuters open source software, removing the vital freedoms identified in the open source definition, including free distribution and no discrimination against a specific field of endeavor. OSI President Simon Phipps called the Commons Clause an &#8220;abrogation of software freedom&#8221; after Redis changed its license.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Redis just went proprietary, which sucks.<a href=\"https://t.co/CfIN99Cz5q\">https://t.co/CfIN99Cz5q</a></p>\n<p>No, this is not just \"a limitation concerning fair use\", it is an abrogation of software freedom.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Simon Phipps (@webmink) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/webmink/status/1032016976170967040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">August 21, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>In light of these recent conversations, OSI is calling organizations to band together in recognition of its authority to maintain a single, standard definition of open source:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Recently there have been efforts to undermine the integrity of open source by claiming there is no need for a single, authoritative definition. These efforts are motivated by the interests of a few rather than the benefit of all, and are at odds with the principles that have so demonstratively served us  well in the past decades. If allowed to continue, these efforts will erode the trust of both users and contributors, and hinder the innovation that is enabled by open source software, just as surely as having multiple definitions of a kilogram would erode and undermine commerce.</p></blockquote>\n<p>OSI reached out first to its <a href=\"https://opensource.org/affiliates\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Affiliate Members</a>, which includes the WordPress open source project, but not all members have responded in time for the publication of the post this week.

I got some really upsetting tweets. After that it started focusing on #yoastcon. It seems like they want to show the hypocrisy in our statements about women. I never spoke at SEO events before, though I have been to SEOktoberfest. It felt totally welcoming back then. That being said, the pictures and movies aren’t something I particularly enjoy watching. I do think they&#8217;re bad, but also a bit out of context. The environment at Yoast is nothing like that. And although my husband likes to party (as do I), I feel he’s always been a strong believer in equal rights and opportunities. I think we all make mistakes and learn from them. At Yoast, we’re really trying to improve inequality with both the diversity fund and my empowerment project.</p></blockquote>\n<p>For those watching the #yoastcon hashtag, the way the situation unfolded it almost seemed like a coordinated personal attack on de Valk, especially given how the SEOktoberfest videos were spliced together with the YoastCon promotional videos. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/explorionary\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">David Cohen</a>, a Philadelphia-based Digital Marketing Director who previously worked at a large SEO agency, started the conversation by publishing de Valk&#8217;s old tweets that he had found years ago when researching Yoast and its founder.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As far as the tweets from Joost are concerned, I&#8217;ve known about them since 2014,&#8221; Cohen said. &#8220;I just never knew what to do with them or how to proceed questioning why that behavior was perfectly acceptable for him.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As far as the harassment and abuse in the SEO industry, particularly at the SEO conferences, I&#8217;ve known about this since 2011 after seeing it firsthand while working at a large SEO agency in Philly, Seer Interactive.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said that he began publicly criticizing people he calls &#8220;SEO celebs&#8221; in 2014, for &#8220;saying they are against the SEO harassment and abuse, claiming to be &#8216;male feminists,&#8217; yet knowingly covering up the abuse and enabling the abusers who happen to also be their friends, peers, colleagues, etc.&#8221;</p>\n<p>While the discussion on the #yoastcon hashtag seems centered around de Valk&#8217;s admitted indiscretions, Cohen said his objective in publicizing the old tweets goes beyond de Valk. He&#8217;s calling out other leaders in the industry who he alleges have harassed and abused women for years. </p>\n<p>&#8220;This started a solo mission to take action as a messenger of questions for the group of SEOs most prominent figures who hold the power of influence over the industry about the 10+ year ongoing issue of alleged harassment and abuse of women in the SEO world, particularly at SEO conferences between 2009 and 2012 era.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Cohen said the timing with YoastCon was &#8220;a mission looking for direct and public answers on this topic once and for all while they were all gathered together at the event.&#8221; He began tweeting about these issues well before the event and was using the #yoastcon hashtag to call out other SEO industry leaders for the past few months. </p>\n<p>When asked about his motive, Cohen said he simply wants answers from de Valk, Rand Fishkin, his wife Geraldine, John Doherty, Martin MacDonald, Marcus Tandler, and others regarding what he perceives to be hypocrisy in the SEO industry.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Why has it been totally cool for the SEO celebs, rock stars, ninjas, and conference speakers to be misogynists, to objectify and sexualize women, to hire Playmates for their SEO events, and to engage in behavior that would easily be classified as &#8216;toxic masculinity?\'&#8221; Cohen said. He claims that industry leaders have been covering up harassment and abuse that they have known about and have refused to help the women who have been abused. Cohen and several others who have been circulating the tweets claim that victims of this abuse have been contacting them to share their stories but have not yet gone public with them.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I chose to act on this now because I wanted answers to two questions from specific people: 1. Do you know of alleged harassment or abuse because someone went to you directly and told their story? And if so, did you refuse to use your power and influence to help them at the risk of your own professional and personal interests?&#8221; Cohen said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;As for Joost, going with the &#8216;if I offended anyone&#8217; apology approach is empty and lacks personal accountability for behaviors that are completely misaligned with words. He had to respond publicly. But the question remains open &#8211; why?&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 08 Feb 2019 04:42:54 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Release Candidate\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6577\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/02/wordpress-5-1-release-candidate/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3950:\"<p>The first release candidate for WordPress 5.1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is an important milestone, as the release date for WordPress 5.1 draws near. &#8220;Release Candidate&#8221; means that the new version is ready for release, but with millions of users and thousands of plugins and themes, it’s possible something was missed.

Riad Benguella, the project&#8217;s technical lead for phase 2, published a demo of the block and its settings. Users can set the number of items displayed and also toggle on/off the author, date, and excerpt.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/rss-block.gif?ssl=1\"><img /></a></p>\n<p>RSS is still relevant today as one of the linchpins of the open web and Gutenberg makes it possible to easily place a feed inside a post or page. (This feature was previously limited to widgetized areas.) The creation of this block is part of a larger effort to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">port all of WordPress&#8217; existing core widgets over to blocks</a>.</p>\n<p>Version 5.0 also introduces a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/13510\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon Kindle embed block</a>, providing an <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/b?ie=UTF8&node=13489836011\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">instant preview</a> from an Amazon Kindle URL. WordPress already has oembed support of Amazon Kindle URLs but it was missing from the Embeds section of the accordion in the block inserter.</p>\n<p>One of the most exciting additions in this release is a new <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/10925\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">FocalPointPicker for the Cover block</a>. It allows users to visually select the ideal center point of an image and returns it as a pair of coordinates that are converted into &#8216;background-position&#8217; attributes. The result is that the user has more control over how the image is cropped. This feature solves so many problems users have experienced in cropping and displaying images in their WordPress themes and content. The FocalPointPicker was created as a reusable component so that developers can use it to build other blocks with the same capabilities, providing an experience that is consistent with core.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cV33J4yy5Il\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cldup.com/aJ-h5zq4wa.gif?resize=627%2C423&ssl=1\" alt=\"Focal point picker\" width=\"627\" height=\"423\" /></a></p>\n<p>The changes included in Gutenberg 5.0 are immediately available for those running the plugin on their sites but only for WordPress 5.0+. This release drops support for earlier versions of WordPress. The updates in Gutenberg 5.0 are planned to be rolled into WordPress 5.2.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 07 Feb 2019 18:32:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"Post Status: Building Multidots, with Anil Gupta\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=55213\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://poststatus.com/building-multidots-with-anil-gupta/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1562:\"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/draft\">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\">on iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://play.google.com/music/m/Ih5egfxskgcec4qadr3f4zfpzzm?t=Post_Status__Draft_WordPress_Podcast\">Google Play</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\">Stitcher</a>, and <a href=\"http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss\">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

I know we are all stereotyped as scammers and thieves but trust me, a lot of us own and operate legit (online) businesses. Just like in every country, there are good and bad people and we are no exception.</p>\n<p>I had a great childhood. Everything was fine and rosy until I lost my Dad which meant I had to shoulder the responsibility of my family as the first child. I manage to finish secondary school and was awarded the best Math student.</p>\n<h3>Introduction to The Internet / Web</h3>\n<p>Back then in secondary school, I had a rich friend who owned a Nokia phone (that could browse the internet) he brings to class which he uses to play games and do fun stuff online even though we weren’t allowed to bring nor use a phone in the class. (Funny right? :D)</p>\n<p>I have always been a football lover (called soccer in the U.S). I still play very well and support Chelsea FC. So each time I have the opportunity to use his phone, I always visit Goal.com to read football news especially concerning my team Chelsea FC of England.</p>\n<p>Being a very inquisitive person, I wanted to learn how the web works as well as have my own website. I was able to buy a Nokia 3120 classic phone via the menial jobs I did after school.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-2681\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img2.jpg\" alt=\"Nokia 3120\" width=\"413\" height=\"500\" /></p>\n<p>I visited Google and search how to create my <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Application_Protocol\">wapsite</a>. We refer to mobile phones optimized sites as “wapsite”. The result of my search were filled with site builders like xtgem.com and wapzan.com.</p>\n<p>I chose the xtgem.com and discovered I needed an email address to sign up. Didn’t know what that means so I googled it and eventually created a Yahoo email address. Finally registered and built my first website. Sadly, the site is no longer online but I was able to get a screenshot of the site thanks to <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/\">Wayback Machine</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-2680\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/img1-786x1024.png\" alt=\"WAPsite built by Collins\" width=\"786\" height=\"1024\" /></p>\n<p>I had to learn HTML and CSS from <a href=\"https://www.w3schools.com/\">w3schools</a> to build the site and it came out well didn’t it?</p>\n<p>I later moved on to wapka.mobi site builder which allows you to build dynamic websites such as a social network or forum using its own programming language called “wapka tags”. I was able to build a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20120915021200/http:/www.wapden.net:80/index.html\">community/forum</a>, <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121211011719/http:/www.smsbag.tk:80/index.html\">sms collection</a> and a <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20121029021153/http:/www.wapbooks.tk:80/index.html\">file sharing</a> site.</p>\n<p>I later came across <a href=\"http://www.simplemachines.org/\">simple machine forum</a> and <a href=\"https://mybb.com/\">MyBB</a>, I learned them deeply and used them to build forums and community sites for interested people.</p>\n<h3>Meeting WordPress</h3>\n<p>I came across a Facebook group called BloggersLab and discovered I could make money blogging. Two prominent platform at the time to create a blog was Blogger.com and WordPress. I chose WordPress because WordPress blogs were always pretty.</p>\n<p>From my savings, I bought the cheapest hosting plan from a local web hosting here in Nigeria and installed WordPress using Softaculous included in cPanel and started writing wapka.mobi tutorials. See <a href=\"https://w3guy.com/?s=wapka\">https://w3guy.com/?s=wapka</a>.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I did all this with my Nokia phone.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Here’s how I publish a new post: first I write it on a notebook before publishing on my blog. I was also building mobile sites for people for small amount of money.</p>\n<p>I couldn’t go to the university because of my precarious financial situation. I continue to do menial jobs during the day and started learning PHP in the evenings and at night using my mobile phone via w3schools.com. I later was able to get a cheap old IBM Thinkpad laptop which I used in getting eBooks from torrent sites because I couldn’t afford them at the time and also to practice coding. Mind you, I was also blogging about the stuff I was learning on w3guy.com</p>\n<p>I later took up a job teaching children at a school primarily because I got tired of the menial jobs and wanted to earn enough to take care of my internet data plan. After a while, I became fairly proficient in PHP and even took up a job to build a school management system which was really slow and ugly.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Saved My Life</h3>\n<p>I needed to start making money with the PHP, HTML &amp; CSS skill I had because my blog wasn’t making any money via AdSense. I think I got to the $100 payout on my second year of blogging.</p>\n<p>I came across a post on Sitepoint.com that they were looking for writers. I applied and got in. I started writing PHP and WordPress development tutorials and got paid few hundreds of dollars per article. In Nigeria, that’s quite a lot of money. I was able to improve the life and well-being of my family and I. I also wrote for Smashing Magazine, Designmodo, Tuts+ and Hongkiat.</p>\n<p>I later got admission into a polytechnic to study computer science and decided to stop writing and try to make and sell WordPress plugins for a living.</p>\n<p>I discovered my tutorial on <a href=\"https://designmodo.com/wordpress-custom-login/\">building custom login</a> form on Designmodo was popular with lots of comment so I decided to make a plugin out of it. That was how my first premium plugin <a href=\"https://profilepress.net/\">ProfilePress</a> was born. I wanted to sell it on Codecanyon but it was rejected so I decided to sell it myself. It was and still hard doing development and marketing at the same time.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Thankfully, after a year, it started making enough revenue for me to live pretty comfortably here in Nigeria because the cost of living here is little.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Few years later, I came across a payment processing library for PHP called <a href=\"https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay\">Omnipay</a> which included support for many payment providers like Stripe, PayPal. I use 2Checkout as my payment gateway to sell my plugins via EDD and discovered the driver for 2Checkout in Omnipay was old and unsupported so <a href=\"https://github.com/collizo4sky/omnipay-2checkout\">I built one</a>. I figured I could make money building EDD and WooCommerce payment gateways base on the Omnipay and I did and place them on Codecanyon for sale. They didn’t do well sales wise and I had to stop selling them and moved the 2Checkout gateway for WooCommerce to <a href=\"https://omnipay.io/\">omnipay.io</a>. I have since built an EDD Paddle gateway which I now sell alongside.</p>\n<p>My latest product is <a href=\"https://mailoptin.io/\">MailOptin</a>, a WordPress optin form and automated newsletter plugin. I initially built it for my own need. I figured there might be interest in it so I made a free version and a paid version.</p>\n<p>I currently live on the revenue from my plugins.</p>\n<h3>Wrap Up</h3>\n<p>I am thankful for WordPress because without it, I&#8217;m really not sure I would have been able to live a decent life. Who knows what would have become of me.</p>\n<p>I am also thankful for the community. I have made lots of friends that has been very supportive and helpful in my journey.</p>\n<p>If you live in a third world country like myself and going through hardship, I hope my story will inspire you to be great.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I tell people, life won’t give you what you want. You demand from life what you want. You make these demands by being determined and never giving up on your dreams and aspiration.</p></blockquote>\n<p>If you are poor perhaps because you came from a humble and poor background, it is not your fault. You can’t go back in time to change things. I implore you to be strong, determined and hustle hard.</p>\n<p>I will end with this story.</p>\n<p>Two guys had become shipwrecked and were directionless-ly drifting on the vast ocean, desperately holding onto a wooden plank.</p>\n<p>A big ship comes along.

Read on to find out what happened in the WordPress project last month.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress Leadership Grows</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In a milestone announcement this month, WordPress project lead, Matt Mullenweg (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>matt</a>), <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/16/expanding-wordpress-leadership/\">named two individuals</a> who are coming on board to expand the leadership team of the project.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Executive Director, Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) will oversee <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">all the contribution teams</a> across the project. As Marketing &amp; Communications Lead, Joost de Valk (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/joostdevalk/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>joostdevalk</a>) will lead <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/marketing/\">the Marketing team</a> and generally oversee improvements to WordPress.org.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Josepha and Joost have contributed to the WordPress project for many years and will certainly have a much larger impact going forward in their new roles.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>WordPress 5.1 Development Continues</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Immediately after the 5.0 release of WordPress, work started on version 5.1 with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1/\">some highly anticipated new features</a> coming out in <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\">the first beta release</a>. Since then, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-2/\">second</a> and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-3/\">third</a> betas have been made available.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the core updates in this release — <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/php-site-health-mechanisms-in-5-1/\">a feature to improve the way in which WordPress handles PHP errors</a> — has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/30/wordpress-5-1-beta-3-delay/\">been pushed back</a> to version 5.2 due to unforeseen issues that would have caused significant delays to the 5.1 release.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to get involved in testing or building WordPress Core? You can install <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">the WordPress Beta Tester plugin</a>, follow <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">the Core team blog</a>, and join the #core channel in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/chat/\">the Making WordPress Slack group</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Further Reading:</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The WordPress Coding Standards team <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress-Coding-Standards/WordPress-Coding-Standards/releases/tag/2.0.0\">released version 2.0</a> this month.</li><li>In her new role as Executive Director, Josepha Haden <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/21/our-strengths-and-challenges/\">looks at what contributors need</a> to help support them more effectively.</li><li>Approximately 2,300 tickets in the Core bug tracker <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/14/follow-up-on-recent-trac-bulk-edit/\">were closed</a> in a large bulk edit this month due to their inactivity over the last two years.</li><li>Autocomplete for usernames has been added to <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\">the WordPress Support Forums</a>, making it much easier to communicate directly with individuals.</li><li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/gutenberg/\">Work continues on the Gutenberg project</a>, expanding into more areas of the WordPress dashboard.</li><li>Since the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">WordPress Support portal</a> release in December, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/docs/2019/01/28/summary-for-docs-team-meeting-28-january-2019/\">work has been ongoing</a> to improve its features and complete the content migration.</li><li>The Plugin Review team has published <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2019/01/28/reminder-about-behavior/\">an important reminder about behavior</a> in the Plugin Directory and support forums.</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Have a story that we should include in the next “Month in WordPress” post?

Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-beta3.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>, and we need your help to get there!</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the features originally slated for WordPress 5.1—the PHP error protection handler—will target WordPress 5.2 instead. Some potential security issues were discovered in the implementation: rather than risk releasing insecure code, the team decided to pull it out of WordPress 5.1. The work in <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46130\">#46130</a> is showing good progress towards addressing the security concerns, if you&#8217;d like to follow development progress on this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Additional Changes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A handful of smaller bugs have also been fixed in this release, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>TinyMCE has been upgraded to version 4.9.2 (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46094\">#46094</a>).</li><li>The block editor has had a couple of bugs fixed (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46137\">#46137</a>).</li><li>A few differences in behaviour between the classic block and the classic editor have been fixed (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46062\">#46062</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46071\">#46071</a>, <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/46085\">#46085</a>).</li><li>When adding <code>rel</code> attributes to links, ensure the value isn&#8217;t empty (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45352\">#45352</a>), and that it works as expected with customizer changesets (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/45292\">#45292</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Developer Notes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 has many changes aimed at polishing the developer experience. To keep you informed, we publish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1+dev-notes/\">developers&#8217; notes</a>&nbsp;on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> throughout the release cycle.

Respondens&#8217; unique design reflects an ethic where subscribers are treated as a community of people who want to be involved in the production of the news they read. In the future, Ernst hopes to market Respondens to support its development and spread the practice of what we might call &#8220;responsive journalism.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Ernst and his colleagues intend to avoid the churn of breaking news by taking a structural focus on the issues they cover, working in the tradition of constructive, problem-solving, or &#8220;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solutions_journalism\">solutions journalism</a>.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">9/ Not just the problem, but what can be done about it.

The constructiveness of this approach may have a lot to do with its calming and humanizing effects.</p>\n<p>Ernst has written several Dutch best-sellers, including a <a href=\"https://dankboek.nl/\"><em>Thank-You Book</em></a> or &#8220;gratitude&#8221; journal that came out of his efforts to overcome anxiety about public speaking. In his reflections on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9vLHFza8Uc&t=4s\">work, overwork, and gratitude</a> for TEDx, Ernst emphasizes that resistance to &#8220;the burnout society&#8221; where &#8220;creativity is crushed&#8221; is a collective task: everyone needs to make daily space for their close relationships where work and media do not intrude.</p>\n<p>I am grateful Ernst took some time after the holidays to talk about his experience with WordPress, collaborative online communities, and democratized journalism. Here is the conversation we had.</p>\n<p><b>DK: What are your thoughts about WordPress today? Have you made any connections or maintained relationships with the WP community in other ways?</b></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> I started using WordPress in 2006 when I launched my personal blog ahead of an internship at a press agency in the United Nations HQ in New York. The fact that I then, as a twenty-year-old, could start a publication in such an easy way, has been crucial in my career and something I will be the WordPress community eternally grateful for. Since then, I have started several sites, most of them running on WordPress. In 2007 I co-founded the blog of The Next Web Conference, now known as <a href=\"http://thenextweb.com/\">thenextweb.com</a>, in 2009 I started a news blog for the Dutch daily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NRC_Next\">nrc.next</a>, and in 2010, as head of digital at the Dutch quality newspaper (NRC Handelsblad), I switched their main site from &#8216;Escenic&#8217; to WordPress. The fact that we could so easily build our own plugins (for example, a liveblog feature to cover the Arab spring) was crucial in the success of that news site. Also, the developers enjoyed their work more, since they could give back to the community.</p>\n<p>I still run my personal site on WordPress, and even though I don&#8217;t publish there anymore, I love to stay in the loop of new WordPress releases and the ever-increasing user-friendliness of the software. In lost moments, I enjoy reading the developers forums and checking their discussions about new releases (I admire the distributed, self-organizing and voluntary efforts of the community) but I&#8217;m not in touch with one of the members. I&#8217;m just an admiring bystander.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: Can you explain when and why you came to see community and membership features as essential to a CMS? What does it look like when the idea of membership/audience inclusion is integral to the software architecture and vision? How are you doing this in Respondens?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> The main consideration was <em>focus</em>. We wanted a CMS that only had features for our writers that we deemed important. We didn&#8217;t want to create any distraction by having other options available — both to our developers as to our writers. If we build it ourselves, we force ourselves to make conscious decisions about every new feature we add. I.e., we wouldn&#8217;t just switch a &#8216;like&#8217; button on in the comment section, simply because it&#8217;s already there. Forcing ourselves to do this made sure we built a laser-focused CMS and publication. The focus and the calm that follows makes it unique. (See &#8220;<a href=\"https://thecorrespondent.com/4108/cultivating-calm-a-design-philosophy-for-the-digital-age/242162492-d0fffdf8\">Cultivating calm: a design philosophy for the digital age</a>.&#8221;)</p>\n<p>Also, our approach to reader interaction — as you mentioned — is a unique asset of our CMS. I elaborate on that in this Medium post, &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/de-correspondent/reinventing-the-rolodex-why-were-asking-our-60-000-members-what-they-know-9be6a857c340\">Reinventing the Rolodex: Why we’re asking our 60,000 members what they know</a>.&#8221; We believe in the democratization of the journalistic research process. Anyone could be a source, anyone has expertise and knowledge to share within a specific niche.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">1/ THREAD: There’s a great untapped resource in journalism, and it’s available to every journalist right now.</p>\n<p>It’s the experience and expertise of your *readers*.</p>\n<p>Giving them the opportunity to share what they know, could fundamentally transform journalism.</p>\n<p>&mdash; Ernst Pfauth (@ejpfauth) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ejpfauth/status/1072573253686882304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">December 11, 2018</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>DK: How does your model of membership-based journalism change at scale, when you have potentially the largest possible national and international audience? Will you still ask your journalists to spend <a href=\"https://medium.com/the-idea/q-a-ernst-jan-pfauth-ceo-co-founder-de-correspondent-e8f67755571a\">30-50% of their time</a> reading and responding to member comments and other feedback? Is this essential (or even possible) to sustain at scale?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> The thought that you see your readers as sources of knowledge and expertise is crucial. It works for the local examples you mentioned, but it can also work for global topics. For example, we interviewed Shell employees from all over the world — who we found through our Dutch members forwarding a call-out. (&#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/de-correspondent/reader-engagement-shell-4bb6d0b8fb84\">How reader engagement helped unearth the Shell tape</a>.&#8221;) We also created the position of &#8220;conversation editor&#8221; to help journalists with the scalability of their reader interaction.</p>\n<p>Yes, there are scale challenges. We see our journalists as conversation leaders and our members as contributing experts. We notice when a journalist gets more feedback from their sources (their readers), they need a research assistant to keep up — for example by highlighting interesting contributions to them or taking over some interviews. These are tasks that can be easily outsourced, as long as the correspondent remains the main point of contact in the comment sections and guides the conversation.</p>\n<p>I don’t see the 30 and 50 percent as time to spend on ‘responding to comments.’ The comments are just a means to an end. The end goal is to involve your audience, so you can get a wider set of sources, become more inclusive and publish richer journalism. We estimate it takes 30 to 50 percent of your time to live up to that mission.</p>\n<p><strong>DK: On the other end of the spectrum, does your model have things to teach small, local journalism and other membership-focused businesses that they don&#8217;t already know? In the new membership-based local journalism I&#8217;ve been watching in the US and Canada — local media startups where there&#8217;s no history or expectation of a printed product or advertising — there&#8217;s a definite limit on the subjects that can be curated and written (or spoken) about in a deep and penetrating way. Is this a low or slow-growth model that simply must be accepted?</strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> It starts with being open about your mission as a journalist (all our new correspondents publish a mission statement when they start working with us) and then telling your audience what you expect from them. It’s about that personal relationship. The CMS, practices, technology and resources all follow. But it’s the being open to your audience input and being open about your shared goal with them that’s crucial. Anyone can do that. And when you start, it might even be easier to do it on a small scale, but it’s more intimate, and you can scale up as you get better at it.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_53976\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img class=\"wp-image-53976 size-full\" src=\"https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/295952-tc_team_behindthescenes_07-521ac4-original-1542160485.jpg\" alt=\"The Correspondent team\" width=\"4000\" height=\"2667\" /><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">The Correspondent team browses their unbreaking newspaper.

Are you still a practitioner of journaling and daily gratitude? Have your thoughts on that changed or deepened? </strong></p>\n<p><strong>EP:</strong> I still write in a gratitude journal every night and noticed this three-year habit has really made me more aware of ordinary but beautiful moments in life, and also taught me to enjoy the process instead of the end goal. I save my evenings and (80% of) my weekends for family and friends — and always have my phone on DND in those hours. Also: I don&#8217;t check my email before I have left my apartment.

One of those was the need for various teams across the project to work together better. The friction during the 5.0 development cycle was beneficial in that it surfaced areas where the project can grow and sparked conversations that are already leading to improvements. </p>\n<p>Last week Mullenweg announced that WordPress is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/16/expanding-wordpress-leadership/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">expanding its leadership team</a> to include Josepha Haden in a new Executive Director role and Joost de Valk as the Marketing and Communications Lead. These new roles better distribute project leadership to more individuals who have demonstrated the ability and judiciousness to guide large, diverse teams towards success. Haden will be overseeing WordPress&#8217; contributor teams and de Valk is leading the marketing team and overseeing improvements to WordPress&#8217; websites and other outlets. </p>\n<p>The Executive Director role is particularly critical for the health of the project, as contributor and community feedback pours in across so many different mediums. Tracking all of this information and taking it into consideration amounts to a full-time job. In her first week in the new role, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/21/our-strengths-and-challenges/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Haden is seeking feedback regarding the challenges contributors face</a> when working on the project. She identified seven challenges which seem to resonate with many who have commented:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Coordinating on collaborative work between teams</li>\n<li>Aligning our work better to project goals/values</li>\n<li>Understanding team roles, leadership structures, and decision making</li>\n<li>Clarifying the differences between open source and open commit</li>\n<li>Tracking conversations and progress across the project</li>\n<li>Raising project-wide concerns more easily</li>\n<li>Improving how we recognize and celebrate success</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Responses from contributors have so far revolved around a similar theme &#8211; the desire for more clearly-defined projects and goals for teams, along with more communication from leadership. </p>\n<p>&#8220;Define goals and deliverables for each project deliverable,&#8221; Daniel Bachhuber suggested. &#8220;Once these are defined, it’s much easier to estimate the level of effort and resources required. Distinguish between full-time sponsored, part-time sponsored, and completely volunteer labor. Each of these three do not work at the same pace. It’ll be much easier to estimate a team’s velocity if you know what type of labor you have to work with.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Meagen Voss offered some valuable insight from a newer contributor&#8217;s perspective. She said the leadership of the project is very unclear and that people could benefit from that information being more prominently published. She also <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2019/01/21/our-strengths-and-challenges/#comment-4363\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">suggested</a> that WordPress explore the idea of having ambassadors for each team to facilitate communication and collaboration across projects.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You get to know your team very well, but no so much other teams. I’ve met some great folks in Slack and am getting to know the two groups I’m involved in super well. But if I have an issue or a question that needs to be addressed to another group, then I would have to hang out in that team’s channel for a while to figure out who the right person is to get in touch with. Identifying “ambassadors” or points of contact for each group could be a quick and helpful way to address that.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The conversation is still open for contributors to jump in and share their own challenges and suggestions. Haden plans to follow up with the next steps after gathering more feedback. Action born out of these conversations has the potential to greatly improve contributors&#8217; experiences working together, resulting in fewer people burning out on communication struggles or losing momentum from lack of clearly defined objectives.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 22:23:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"Matt: Thich Nhat Hanh on Tea\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48949\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/thich-nhat-hanh-on-tea/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:331:\"<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>Drink your tea slowly and reverently, as if it is the axis on which the world earth revolves &#8211; slowly, evenly, without rushing toward the future.</p><cite>— Thich Nhat Hanh in <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009U9S6VM/\">The Miracle of Mindfulness</a></cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 21:27:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Launches New Mobile Apps for iOS and Android\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86988\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-launches-new-mobile-apps-for-ios-and-android\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3641:\"<p>This week marks the first <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/try-the-new-woocommerce-mobile-app-for-key-metrics-order-look-up-and-notifications-cha-ching/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">public release</a> of WooCommerce&#8217;s new mobile app for <a href=\"https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.woocommerce.android\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Android</a> and the improved version for <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/id1389130815\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">iOS</a>. WooCommerce began beta testing the Android app late last year and the original iOS app has been updated to offer the same features.</p>\n<p>This first release should be considered a basic start that is mostly useful for tracking store performance with detailed stats and getting alerts for new orders and product reviews. Users cannot add or edit products and the app does not yet allow for switching between stores. The first release offers basic order management and fulfillment but does not include the ability to change order status. The mobile apps don&#8217;t yet live up to their tagline of &#8220;Your store in your pocket,&#8221; but it&#8217;s a good starting place. </p>\n<p>According to the Google Play Store, the WooCommerce app has been installed more than 10,000 times and the response from users has been mixed. The app is averaging a 2.5-star rating after early reviews from 45 users. The iOS app has received similar responses. Many of the negative reviews are due to connection/login issues and the requirement for stores to use Jetpack.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This has promise, but get rid of the need for Jetpack,&#8221; one reviewer wrote. &#8220;There are other secure ways of syncing up. Other apps have done it for years. This app has been long overdue, but is poor in execution when you need to install a plugin that tends to bog down your site and that most don&#8217;t need. Give an alternative means of syncing and allow us to edit at least the basics of a product on the go.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WooCommerce marketing representative Marina Pape explained the Jetpack requirement in a post announcing the mobile apps&#8217; launch:  </p>\n<blockquote><p>The Jetpack plugin connects your self-hosted site to a WordPress.com account and provides a common authentication interface across lots of server configurations and architectures.</p>\n<p>Both Apple and Google only allow a single trusted sender for pushes for security reasons (read more), making Jetpack the best way for us to give you modern mobile app features like push notifications.</p></blockquote>\n<p>In order to connect sites with the app, Jetpack creates a shadow site on WordPress.com&#8217;s servers and syncs quite a bit of data. Although this <a href=\"https://jetpack.com/support/what-data-does-jetpack-sync/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">list of data</a> is transparently outlined, the Jetpack requirement is a deal breaker for some users. They either object to sharing their data or believe the plugin will slow down their stores. Until the app&#8217;s features are more compelling than the detriments users perceive in Jetpack, it may lose a few users based on this requirement.</p>\n<p>According to <a href=\"https://trends.builtwith.com/shop\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuiltWith</a>, WooCommerce is now the most popular shopping cart technology used by 22% of the top 1 million websites, with competitors Shopify and Magento not too far behind at 17% and 13% respectively. Having a new mobile app should help WooCommerce remain competitive, but the team needs to keep iterating on the app to make it more useful for those managing stores on the go.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 23 Jan 2019 05:35:53 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: Gutenberg Phase 2 to Update Core Widgets to Blocks, Classic Widget in Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86953\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-phase-2-to-update-core-widgets-to-blocks-classic-widget-in-development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5791:\"<p>Gutenberg phase 2 development is underway and one of the first orders of business is porting all existing core widgets to blocks.

Mark Uraine, a designer who works at Automattic, created some mockups to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13204\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">kick off the discussion</a> about what this screen might look like. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cloudup.com/cW5MOA5gsTG\"><img src=\"https://i1.wp.com/cldup.com/o9-F6ebs7m.gif?resize=627%2C421&ssl=1\" alt=\"Widgets as blocks\" width=\"627\" height=\"421\" /></a></p>\n<p>These mockups are just explorations of where widgets may be headed next, and they do not take into account everything that will be required of this screen. </p>\n<p>Nick Halsey, one of the maintainers for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/components/customize/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress&#8217; Customize component</a> recommended abandoning this screen altogether in favor of showing widget block areas in the Customizer:</p>\n<blockquote><p>The widgets admin screen has a fundamental disconnect with the way that widget areas actually work &#8211; with different areas showing in different parts of the screen and potentially on different parts of the site. It will be very difficult to clearly reflect the frontend page structure on this screen in a way that users will be able to understand. Experimenting with contextual approaches to this experience in the customizer offers numerous opportunities for this fundamental problem to be solved. Starting with the visible edit shortcuts that are already in core, revamped widgets could be edited directly on the frontend (of the customize preview) or in an overlay that is more directly related to the display on a particular screen. The ability to navigate to different parts of the site within the customize preview solves a problem that this screen will never be able to address.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Getting blocks to work in the Customizer is also part of phase 2, but conversation on the ticket related to wp-admin/widgets.php indicates the team is not going to abandon this screen just yet. </p>\n<p>&#8220;While this screen will eventually be deprecated in the future, especially as more of the site is built in Gutenberg, it&#8217;s a necessary &#8220;baby step&#8221; to get us all there together,&#8221; Uraine said. &#8220;Maybe the best thing is to keep the existing layout, but just allow the use of all blocks within the accordion content areas? This will keep our resources and investment minimal on this particular piece with just a few suggested tweaks to the mockup in the initial post. It will also allow us to move to the Customizer more quickly.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Gutenberg accessibility contributor Andrea Fercia encouraged contributors to address accessibility before creating visual mockups by designing the information architecture first. He encouraged them to organize the required information and controls while thinking about how someone might navigate them in a linear way. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The customizer is not fully accessible,&#8221; Fercia said. &#8220;The admin widgets screen is the only place where persons with accessibility needs have a chance to manage widgets without having to face big accessibility barriers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Discussion on the future of the widget management screen continues in the ticket and contributors are looking to get more input during this exploration stage. There&#8217;s also a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/22\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">project board</a> where anyone can share a blog post with their own explorations.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/projects/20\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Porting widgets to blocks</a> has its own project board if you want to follow along or jump in on an issue. Most of the core blocks are already finished and a handful are still in progress. </p>\n<p>Updating the widgets management page and bringing blocks into the Customizer is a major overhaul but will further unify WordPress&#8217; interface for editing and previewing content. Widgets have served WordPress well over the years, making it easy for users to customize their websites without having to know how to code. The feature has also <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/the-future-of-wordpress-widgets-a-better-ui-with-real-time-previews\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">survived many evolutions</a>, eventually <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/widget-customizer-approved-for-wordpress-3-9\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">making its way into the Customizer five years ago in WordPress 3.9</a>. One of the limitations with widgets is that they can only be used in &#8220;widgetized&#8221; areas. Transforming widgets into blocks removes that limitation and makes it possible to use widgets in posts and pages as well.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 22 Jan 2019 21:11:48 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Beta 2\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6550\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-2/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4498:\"<p>WordPress 5.1 Beta 2 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong> so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site.

WPML founder Amir Helzer suspects that the attacker is a former employee. </p>\n<p>&#8220;The customer is an ex-employee who left an exploit on the server (not WPML plugin) before leaving. Besides fixing the damage, we’ll also be taking legal actions,&#8221; Helzer said Saturday night.</p>\n<p>The WPML team worked around the clock over the weekend to secure their systems and sent out an email informing customers of the incident. They also assured customers that the WPML plugin does not contain an exploit and that payment information was not compromised. The company published an <a href=\"https://wpml.org/2019/01/wpml-org-site-back-to-normal-after-an-attack-during-the-weekend/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">announcement</a> to their website, detailing the incident and their response: </p>\n<blockquote><p>We updated wpml.org, rebuilt everything and reinstalled everything. We secured access to the admin use 2-factor authentication and minimized the access that the web server has to the file system.</p>\n<p>These are more precautions than actual response to the hack. Our data shows that the hacker used inside information (an old SSH password) and a hole that he left for himself while he was our employee.</p>\n<p>This hack was not done via an exploit in WordPress, WPML or another plugin, but using this inside information. In any case, the damage is great and it’s done already.</p></blockquote>\n<p>WPML urges customers not to click on any links in the email the attacker sent out and recommends they change their passwords for wpml.org. The attacker has customer names, emails, and sitekeys, but WPML said the sitekeys cannot be used to push changes to customer websites.</p>\n<p>Helzer is convinced that the attack was an inside job and suspects two former employees. He and his team are working to provide evidence to the authorities. He said the the nature of the attack demonstrates that it was likely not an outside hacker:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>The first time our site was breached was on the day we fired an employee, who had access to our servers. We didn&#8217;t identify the breach at that time. However, once we got hacked, we analyzed the original hole and we found in our log when it was placed (yup, he deleted the log, but he didn&#8217;t delete the backup). Now that we finished cleaning up the mess, we&#8217;re going through all logs and collecting the full evidence.</li>\n<li>The attacker targeted specific code and database tables that are unique to our site and not generic WordPress or WPML tables.</li>\n<li>The attacker crafted the attack so that it would cause us long term damage and not be apparent in first sight. That long-term damage is very difficult to guess without knowing our business objectives and challenges. This is information that our employees have, but we don&#8217;t disclose.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The idea that a former employee who is known to the company would risk performing these illegal actions is difficult to grasp, even in the case of someone who was fired and may have been acting in retaliation. The risks of being caught seem too great.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In many jurisdictions including the USA, this is jail time,&#8221; Wordfence CEO Mark Maunder <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mmaunder/status/1086839572384940033\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a>. &#8220;So I find it quite incredible that an employee would leave a backdoor, use it to deface their site, steal their data and email all subscribers. This is the infosec equivalent of walking into a police precinct and tagging the wall while the cops watch.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Helzer said the incident should serve as a wakeup call for companies that employ remote workers. It highlights the importance of having procedures in place for revoking employee access to all systems used as part of day to day operations.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We have to admit that our site was not secured well enough,&#8221; Helzer said. &#8220;If someone previously had admin access and stopped working for us, we should have been more careful and avoided this situation.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This can be a wakeup call for others. We talk a lot about the benefits or remote work and most of the WordPress industry works remotely. This made us realize that we need to be a lot more pessimistic when we allow any access to our system.</p>\n<p>&#8220;For example, the fact that we’re now coding for ourselves a requirement to login with 2fa, means that we’re not alone in this exposed situation.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The attacker&#8217;s unauthorized email and WPML&#8217;s response email went out over the weekend, so many customers will be learning of the incident today when they return to work. Helzer said customers have been supportive so far.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think that customers appreciate the fact that we contacted them as fast as we could and we dropped everything and ran to handle this,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I think that we&#8217;ll still have damage. Clients did not run away from us right now but a good reputation is something that you build over years. A nasty incident like this stays &#8216;on your record.&#8217; This is our livelihood and we take it seriously.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 21 Jan 2019 16:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"WPTavern: WPML Website Hacked, Customer Emails Compromised\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86908\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wptavern.com/wpml-website-hacked-customer-emails-compromised\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3452:\"<p>On Saturday, January 19, WPML customers started reporting having received an email from someone who seems to have hacked the plugin&#8217;s website and gained access to customer information.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Got same mail and there is this text on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/wpml?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#wpml</a> website visible now.

The <a href=\"https://newsinitiative.withgoogle.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Google News Initiative</a> has contributed $1.2 million towards the development of &#8220;<a href=\"http://newspack.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Newspack</a>&#8221; on top of WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. </p>\n<p>Automattic and Google have joined with other contributing partners from the broader world of journalism for a total of $2.4 million in funding for the first year of the project. These partners include <a href=\"https://www.lenfestinstitute.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Lenfest Institute for Journalism</a> ($400K), ConsenSys, the venture studio behind <a href=\"https://civil.co/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Civil Media</a> ($350K), The <a href=\"http://kf.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">John S. and James L. Knight Foundation</a> ($250K), and an additional partner who will join later this month. <a href=\"https://spiritedmedia.com/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Spirited Media</a> and <a href=\"https://fundjournalism.org/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">News Revenue Hub</a> will also contribute to the creation of the platform.</p>\n<p>Local news organizations are critical for a healthy democratic society, keeping the public informed about things happening close to home. The move to digital news consumption has forced consolidation in the news industry where larger players have come out ahead while smaller publications struggle to stay above water. </p>\n<p>In a report called &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.usnewsdeserts.com/reports/expanding-news-desert/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">The Expanding News Desert</a>,&#8221; published in 2018, researchers at the University of North Carolina found that nearly one in five newspapers has disappeared during the past 15 years. Many others have become &#8220;ghost newspapers,&#8221; shells of what they once were &#8211; either absorbed by larger dailies that purchased them or suffering from a severely pared back newsroom that is unable to adequately cover local events.</p>\n<p>WordPress.com has amassed an expert team to address this crisis in local news. The Newspack platform will cater to the technological and editorial needs of smaller newsrooms, with the monetization tools to make their work sustainable. WordPress.com is currently accepting <a href=\"https://newspack.blog/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">applications for charter participants</a> and plans to launch in beta near the end of July 2019.</p>\n<h3>Open Source Newspack Platform to Offer an Alternative to Expensive Proprietary CMS&#8217;s</h3>\n<p>The WordPress community has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/1084900673559371776\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">speculated</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mor10/status/1084887261471072257\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">widely</a> about what shape Newspack will take, whether it will be like WordPress.com VIP tailored to publications or something similar to Jetpack with a curated set of tools that could be used by self-hosted sites through SaaS upgrades. According to WordPress.com president Kinsey Wilson, a former executive for NPR and The New York Times who joined Automattic in 2018, the platform may end up being a hybrid of approaches. </p>\n<p>&#8220;It’s still very early in the process, but I expect elements of both VIP and Jetpack to inform this,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;Newspack will be part of the WordPress.com platform, but we’re going to be working on a highly curated experience tailored to these news organizations, with individualized support available across editorial and business.&#8221; </p>\n<p>The platform will support plugins that solve problems publishers experience at the local level and will also include Gutenberg-specific editorial tools.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It will leverage Gutenberg,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;A few examples of the tools that might be launched with Newspack include email integration for marketing and editorial; programmatic ad integration, analytics, real-time backups, and revenue generating tools for subscriptions and e-commerce. We hope to work closely with partners across the WordPress ecosystem for potential ways to work with services that are beneficial to news organizations.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most important distinction of the Newspack platform is that it will be open source. That also puts it directly in competition with proprietary CMS&#8217;s like Arc, Vox Media&#8217;s Chorus CMS, and MediaOS, that are prominent in the news industry right now. Instead of working together, larger media companies have opted to build their own CMS&#8217;s and many of them are also <a href=\"http://www.niemanlab.org/2018/11/is-it-finally-time-for-media-companies-to-adopt-a-common-publishing-platform/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">licensing enterprise versions to publishers or offering them as SaaS solutions</a>.</p>\n<p>I asked Kinsey if Newspack will be something news organizations could self-host or if it will be inextricably tied to WordPress.com&#8217;s infrastructure. WordPress.com is making it open in the sense that publishers will not be tied to using it forever if they want to their information and copy the same setup somewhere else.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It is not only open source, it will be designed so that at any point in time any individual site or even a commercial competitor could capture an image of the setup and port it to another platform,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;The value we offer is our knowledge of the news industry, our ability to keep pace with new requirements, and our ability to vet various plug-ins and open-source contributions to the project for security and interoperability &#8212; all at an attractive operating cost of between $1,000 and $2,000 per month. In addition, we hope to expose news organizations to a wider community of like-minded developers and to create an on-boarding system that simplifies the setup.&#8221; </p>\n<p>Operating costs on proprietary platforms are much higher than what WordPress.com is planning for Newspack. Arc costs smaller publishers <a href=\"https://digiday.com/media/washington-post-building-tech-platform-arc/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$10,000 per month in software licensing fees</a> and can cost up to $150,000 monthly for larger publications. Vox media executives <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/vox-media-to-begin-licensing-publishing-technology-chorus-1531828800\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">told the Wall Street Journal</a> that the company &#8220;plans to sell Chorus at different pricing tiers depending on the demands of each customer with fees in the six and seven-figure ranges.&#8221; Small local news publications are often priced out of using a publishing platform like this.</p>\n<p>&#8220;It breaks my heart how much of their limited resources these organizations still sink into closed-source or dead-end technology,&#8221; Automattic CEO Matt Mullenweg said in a <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/journalism-and-newspack/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">post</a> introducing Newspack on his blog. &#8220;Open source is clearly the future, and if we do this right Newspack can be the technology choice that lasts with them through the decades, and hopefully our 15 years of growth lends some credibility to our orientation to build things for the long term.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s support of Newspack is in line with its history of building with and <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/google-launches-opensource-dev-as-an-introduction-to-open-source\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">supporting open source projects</a>. When asked for clarification on Google&#8217;s investment in the project, Kinsey said, &#8220;It is a donation that is intended to support work that otherwise would not likely find commercial support because of the relatively modest means of small digital publishers.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s Newspack announcement comes on the heels of the news of <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2019/01/16/when-digital-first-media-gannetts-hostile-suitor-comes-town/2579392002/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Digital First Media&#8217;s unsolicited $1.36 billion bid for Gannett</a>. The future of local news is tenuous, as larger players in the industry press for more consolidation and cost-cutting journalism. In the same week, Facebook, who has had a hot and cold relationship with publishers, announced the company is investing <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/doing-more-to-support-local-news\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$300 million to support local news</a>.</p>\n<p>In recognition of the dire situation facing many local newsrooms, the largest companies on the web are committing funds to help them find a sustainable business model. WordPress.com&#8217;s Newspack platform, with its affordable, open source alternative to proprietary systems, is positioned to make a strong impact during this seminal time in the evolution of the news industry. </p>\n<p>&#8220;By itself, an open source CMS is not going to help news organizations remain independent,&#8221; Kinsey said. &#8220;However, by helping new, emerging organizations overcome the complexity and cost typically associated with technology deployment and instead allowing them to focus resources on journalism and smart business practices, we think we can help them become more sustainable.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 17 Jan 2019 22:52:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"Matt: My TED Video on the Future of Work\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:22:\"https://ma.tt/?p=48932\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"https://ma.tt/2019/01/ted-the-future-of-work/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2707:\"<p>I was thrilled to participate in TED’s new video series, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\">The Way We Work</a>, and not surprisingly I made the case that distributed work is <a href=\"https://qz.com/694410/automattic-has-figured-out-the-right-tools-for-remote-working/\">where everything is headed</a>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<div id=\"fb-root\"></div>&version;<div class=\"fb-video\"><blockquote cite=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\" class=\"fb-xfbml-parse-ignore\"><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/TEDsTheWayWeWork/videos/294277961234005/\">Why Working from Home Is Better for Business</a><p>This company is so dedicated to remote working that they literally don&#039;t have an office.

What I really love about this video in particular is that we get into the specifics of <em>how</em> a company can start to embrace a culture of letting employees work from anywhere, even if it started out as a traditional office with everyone in the same place. Automattic never started that way, so even as we’ve scaled up to more than <a href=\"https://automattic.com/work-with-us/\">840 people</a> in 68 countries, there’s never been a question — it’s now built in to our entire culture.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For distributed work to scale up, it’s going to require more CEOs, workers, and managers to test the waters. Any company can experiment with distributed work — just pick a day or two of the week in which everyone works from home, I suggest Tuesdays and Thursdays, then build the tools and systems to support it. Yes, that may require some shuffling of meetings, or more written documentation versus verbal real-time discussion. But I think companies will be surprised how quickly it will “just work.” <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the companies don’t experiment, workers may force them to do it anyway: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I don\'t think tech folks quite understand how pervasive remote work has become.

Previously, the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">plugin</a> allowed users to display a grid of products by category. The new version introduces a Featured Product Block with design options for customizing nearly everything about the display, including color overlay, price and description, text alignment, call-to-action button, and the product photo. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 1.3.0 also introduces a Hand-Picked Products block that displays a grid of manual selections that can be ordered in different ways. Other new blocks include the following, which display as a grid and can be filtered by category:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Best Selling Products block</li><li>Top Rated Products block</li><li>Newest Products block</li><li>On Sale Products block</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce Blocks is also now a <a href=\"https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/what-is-a-woocommerce-feature-plugin/\">feature plugin</a>, which means that after it is more polished and tested, the plugin can be considered for merge into WooCommerce core. WooCommerce Blocks 1.4 is expected the last week in January with improvements to the Featured Product block and a new Products by Attribute block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In December 2018, WooCommerce <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/posts/people-behind-stores/\">published usage data</a> that indicates 40% of users who could be considered &#8220;established business owners&#8221; also have a brick-and-mortar location, and 27% host events in physical locations. This means that many WooCommerce store owners have multiple channels for selling their products. The data also showed that large stores don&#8217;t always turn to big companies to handle their website development needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Based on that usage data, blocks have the potential to greatly improve the site management experience for many WooCommerce store owners who want to market to different audiences beyond their physical stores. Blocks enable them to easily swap out featured products and customize promotions on products that are selling well in their stores. All of these actions are quick to configure inside the new editor with a live preview. The sooner this feature plugin lands in WooCommerce core, the easier it will be to make these kinds of quick updates. Store owners with sites running on WordPress 5.0+ can take advantage of these blocks now by <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/\">installing the plugin</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 20:11:25 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: CoBlocks Adds Row and Columns Page Building Blocks for Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86811\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/coblocks-adds-row-and-columns-page-building-blocks-for-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3005:\"<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/coblocks/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">CoBlocks</a>, one of the earliest block collections for Gutenberg, has added new page building blocks and tools in the latest <a href=\"https://richtabor.com/coblocks-gutenberg-page-builder/\">1.6 release</a>.

Users can customize the fonts with built-in controls for line-height, letter-spacing, font-weight, and text-transform properties. It also supports customizing fonts for the core heading, paragraph, and button blocks. </p>\n<p>The video below shows a quick demo of column layouts and nested row blocks in action, as well as a few other blocks in the collection. Tabor said the team has more blocks in development that are geared towards full page layout and design. They are also working on a more advanced Google Maps block, feature blocks, and image cards.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The Gutenberg team has been <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/4900\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">discussing a &#8220;section&#8221; block</a> since February 2018, where columns blocks could be placed inside the more generic section container. It&#8217;s on the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/13113\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">roadmap for Phase 2</a> but contributors are taking their time to carefully define how this block will work. In the meantime, plugin developers have created their own versions of sections.</p>\n<p>CoBlocks is currently setting the bar for Gutenberg-powered layouts. When WordPress core gets deeper into site building, this plugin&#8217;s user-friendly approach to rows and columns should provide some inspiration for creating an intuitive page building experience.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 16 Jan 2019 01:49:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:30;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WordPress Support Forums Add @mentions with Auto-complete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86721\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:77:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-support-forums-add-mentions-with-auto-complete\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1852:\"<p>The <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forums/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">WordPress Support forums</a> have been updated to include Twitter/GitHub style <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/2488\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">auto-completion for usernames</a>.

More than $10,000 has come in through WPCamps&#8217; crowdfunding campaign. Shortly before WordCamp US 2018, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/interview-with-rachel-cherry-automattic-pledges-to-fund-wpcampus-accessibility-audit-of-gutenberg\">Automattic pledged to fund the remainder</a> of the audit. The final cost for the chosen vendor is $31,200.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A diverse committee of WordPress, accessibility, and higher education professionals evaluated seven proposals before selecting Tenon LLC. The company&#8217;s Tenon API delivers advanced reporting that assists clients in understanding which issues to prioritize first in the process of building more accessible experiences. The <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/access-monitor-plugin-tests-wordpress-sites-for-accessibility-compliance\">Access Monitor plugin</a> for WordPress is an example of a tool built using this API. Site administrators can use it to identify and tackle accessibility issues with the help of automated testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WPCampus will leave its crowdfunding campaign open until Friday, February 8 to allow more community participation. The organization plans to deliver a progress update on Thursday, January 31, and is aiming to complete the audit by late February.

I will give a special call out to <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00TBKYK60/\">The Paper Menagerie by Ken Liu</a>. Leaving my Kindle Oasis at an airport ended up being a blessing in disguise as I started using the Kindle app on my iPhone a lot more and that&#8217;s become my new favorite habit. (And the physical Kindle was returned!)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a strong travel year, covering 126 cities, 20 countries, and 377k miles. I especially enjoyed visits to Tulum, Iceland, Bodrum, Tonga, Kauai, Lanai, and Courchevel. I finally checked off my bucket list item to become scuba certified and had an amazing opportunity to swim with humpback whales.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://ma.tt/files/2019/01/Tonga-Wanderings-2-of-5-1024x635.jpg\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-48914\" />I was a few feet from <a href=\"https://www.comewander.com/\">Adam Gazzaley when he took this photo</a>.\n\n\n\n<p>I also had lots of opportunities to practice patience, weathered a torrent of personally-directed criticism across every medium, and had a few months that were the hardest I&#8217;ve worked in my career. With the benefit of a little distance, though, those things don&#8217;t loom as large. I learned a ton —&nbsp;often the hard way but often that&#8217;s what it takes —&nbsp;and discovered I had some additional gears that can kick in when needed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I pass solidly into my mid-thirties, I don&#8217;t have any drastic shifts on the horizon but I am looking forward to continuing to strengthen the habits I&#8217;ve been able to develop this past year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other years: <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2003/01/bday/\">19</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2004/01/so-im-20/\">20</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2005/01/hot-barely-legal-matt/\">21</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2006/01/matt-22/\">22</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2007/01/twenty-three/\">23</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2008/01/twenty-four/\">24</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2009/01/twenty-five/\">25</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2010/01/twenty-six/\">26</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2011/01/twenty-seven/\">27</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2012/01/twenty-eight/\">28</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2013/01/twenty-nine/\">29</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/matt-3-0/\">30</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2015/01/thirty-one/\">31</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/thirty-two/\">32</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2017/01/thirty-three/\">33</a>, <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2018/01/thirty-four/\">34</a>, 35.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 12 Jan 2019 00:12:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 342 – GitHub, Commercials, and Governance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58:\"https://wptavern.com?p=86783&preview=true&preview_id=86783\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"https://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-342-github-commercials-and-governance\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2012:\"<p>In this episode, <a href=\"http://jjj.me\">John James Jacoby</a> and I discuss what&#8217;s new in WordPress 5.0.3.

The automatic background update has gone out and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/about/stats/\">23.2% of sites are currently running on 5.0+,</a> with 47.2% hanging back at 4.9. Meanwhile, work on WordPress 5.1 charges forward and <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\">Beta 1</a> is now available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">projects Matt Mullenweg identified for 2019</a> was to merge the Site Health Check plugin into core to assist with debugging and encourage &#8220;good software hygiene.&#8221; The Site Health Check project, formerly called &#8220;ServeHappy,&#8221; began with the goal of helping users get their sites running on supported versions of PHP but has evolved to include other aspects of site maintenance and debugging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 brings one of the most exciting aspects of the Site Health Check project into core. It introduces a new <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">white screen of death (WSOD) protection feature</a> that catches fatal errors so that users can still log into the admin to attempt to resolve the issue. In the past, non-technical users would have to contact their hosting companies or FTP into their files to try to fix plugin or theme compatibility issues by turning things off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In preparation for WordPress&#8217; highly anticipated <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">minimum PHP version increase</a>, 5.1 will display a warning and help users upgrade their version of PHP. The minimum will be bumped to 5.6 in April and, depending on feedback, will be bumped again to 7.0 in December 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This project benefits not just WordPress users, but also the surrounding PHP ecosystem as a whole,&#8221; Jenny Wong said in the <a href=\"https://jwong.co.uk/blog/2019/01/10/how-wordpress-is-dropping-php-end-of-life-versions/\">notes</a> she published from the Site Health Check Project review at WCUS 2018. &#8220;Our hope is that this will prompt a lot of PHP updates across the web.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to take advantage of more features from the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/health-check/\">Site Health Check plugin</a>, you can install it from WordPress.org and visit the Dashboard > Health Check for a detailed overview of your site. It also has a very handy troubleshooting mode that enables a vanilla WordPress session, where all plugins are disabled, and a default theme is used, but only for your user. This works without disrupting the way the site displays to visitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 also introduces some updates for developers, including the ability to replace the cron system with a custom cron handler, set a custom location for WP_DEBUG_LOG, a new <code>wp_blogmeta</code> table, and a few other changes. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is currently slated for release on <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>. The upcoming release is a big step on WordPress&#8217; journey to becoming even more user-friendly. The idea that users will never again be locked out of their sites due to a WSOD is a major enhancement that will greatly improve the way they interact with WordPress&#8217; plugin system. It also makes the prospect of installing new themes and plugins less daunting for non-technical users.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Jan 2019 21:17:46 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.1 Beta 1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6540\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-1-beta-1/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4140:\"<p>WordPress 5.1 Beta 1 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This software is still in development,</strong>&nbsp;so we don’t recommend you run it on a production site. Consider setting up a test site to play with the new version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are two ways to test the WordPress 5.1 beta: try the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a>&nbsp;plugin (you’ll want to select the “bleeding edge nightlies” option), or you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-5.1-beta1.zip\">download the beta here</a>&nbsp;(zip).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 5.1 is slated for release on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/5-1/\">February 21</a>, and we need your help to get there. Here are some of the big items to test so we can find as many bugs as possible in the coming weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Site Health Check</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Health Check is an ongoing project aimed at improving the stability and performance of the entire WordPress ecosystem. The first phase of this project is included in WordPress 5.1. For the first time, WordPress will catch and pause the problem code, so you can log in to your Dashboard and see what the problem is (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/44458\">#44458</a>). Before, you’d have to FTP in to your files or get in touch with your host.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additionally, in April 2019, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/updating-the-minimum-php-version/\">WordPress&#8217; will increase its minimum supported PHP version to 5.6</a>. To help you check if you&#8217;re prepared for this change, WordPress 5.1 will show you a warning and help you upgrade your version of PHP, if necessary.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>For Developers</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>The Cron system can now be more easily replaced with a custom cron handler (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32656\">#32656</a>).</li><li>When starting cron under PHP-FPM, the connection will return a response immediately, even for long running cron jobs (<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2019/01/09/cron-improvements-with-php-fpm-in-wordpress-5-1/\">dev note</a>).</li><li><code>WP_DEBUG_LOG</code> can be set to a custom log location (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/18391\">#18391</a>).</li><li>Introduced the <code>wp_blogmeta</code> table (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/37923\">#37923</a>).</li><li>Added <code>LIKE</code> support to <code>meta_key</code> comparisons in <code>WP_Meta_Query</code> (<a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/42409\">#42409</a>).</li></ul>\n\n\n\n<p>There have been <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=5.1&group=resolution&col=id&col=summary&col=component&col=owner&col=type&col=priority&col=version&order=priority\">over 360 tickets closed</a> in WordPress 5.1, with numerous small bug fixes and improvements to help smooth your WordPress experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Keep your eyes on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for more developer notes (which are <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/5-1+dev-notes/\">assigned</a> the <code>dev-notes</code> tag) in the coming weeks detailing other changes in 5.1 that you should be aware of.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>How to Help</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English?&nbsp;<a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help us translate WordPress into more than 100 languages!</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><em>If you think you’ve found a bug</em></strong><em>, you can post to the&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta\"><em>Alpha/Beta area</em></a><em>&nbsp;in the support forums.

Subscriptions, Related Posts, and Tiled Galleries are now available as blocks under Jetpack in the block inserter tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />New blocks in Jetpack: Related Posts, Subscription Form, and Tiled Galleries\n\n\n\n<p>The most exciting thing for both Related Posts and the Subscription form is that they can now be placed anywhere within post or page content with a live preview. Previously these modules were limited to wherever the theme placed them, or widgetized areas in the case of the Subscription form. Below is an example:</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-jetpack-subscriptions\"><div class=\"jetpack_subscription_widget\">			<form action=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\" method=\"post\" accept-charset=\"utf-8\" id=\"subscribe-blog-487\">\n				<p>Join 42,970 other subscribers</p>\n					<p id=\"subscribe-email\">\n						<label id=\"jetpack-subscribe-label\" for=\"subscribe-field-487\">\n							Email Address						</label>\n						<input type=\"email\" name=\"email\" class=\"required\" value=\"\" id=\"subscribe-field-487\" />\n					</p>\n\n					<p id=\"subscribe-submit\">\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"action\" value=\"subscribe\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"source\" value=\"https://wptavern.com/feed\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"sub-type\" value=\"widget\" />\n						<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"redirect_fragment\" value=\"487\" />\n												<input type=\"submit\" value=\"Subscribe\" name=\"jetpack_subscriptions_widget\" />\n					</p>\n							</form>\n\n			\n		\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p>Tiled galleries can now easily be inserted, manipulated, and previewed in the new editor with all of the same features they had before. Styles and link settings for the galleries can be found in the block sidebar, but they are somewhat limited when <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/new-block-gallery-plugin-offers-a-suite-of-photo-gallery-blocks-for-gutenberg\">compared to other plugins like Block Gallery</a>. Now that the Jetpack team has the basic block in place, they can easily update it with new features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users will need to have their Jetpack accounts connected to WordPress.com to access any of these new blocks, but they will all work on the Free plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have been missing Jetpack shortlinks since Gutenberg was released, you will be pleased to find that Jetpack 6.9 brings them back under a new Jetpack icon at the top right of the block editor.

Layers co-founders David and Marc Perel identified Gutenberg as the main reason for the sale in their farewell <a href=\"https://www.layerswp.com/2019/01/elementor-acquires-layers-wp/\">announcement</a>:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>With the arrival of Gutenberg we realized that a big change was required for Layers to keep pace. A massive investment of time and money was needed so we had to assess the best way forward. Having spent all of our 20&#8217;s working 18 hour days to build beautiful WordPress products we reached a point where we felt it best to partner with another company to try take Layers to the next level.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor is the leading WordPress page builder, with more than a million active installations. CMO Ben Pines said they estimate that number to be closer to 2 million, based on the daily install rate. The company has grown from 6 employees to 55 since it launched in June 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor was well-prepared for Gutenberg&#8217;s inclusion in 5.0. While other page builders are still considering how to move forward with the new editor, Elementor released its <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/block-builder/\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor Blocks for Gutenberg</a> plugin in October 2018, making it possible for users to insert any Elementor template into Gutenberg with one click.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, Layers didn&#8217;t meet the requirements for being listed in the WordPress.org themes directory, because the team decided not to follow best practices for keeping plugin and theme functionality separate. In 2016, <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/layers-ends-exclusive-arrangement-with-envato-launches-new-marketplace\">Perel said they were opting to maintain Layers as a hybrid product</a>, a theme that included plugin-like functionality, in order to keep third-party conflicts to a minimum, which he said also lessened their support burden. This prevented the product from receiving greater exposure on WordPress.org. As larger page builders began to dominate the market, Layers failed to gain the traction it needed to compete. Add Gutenberg to the mix and Layers&#8217; founders were in need of an exit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We feel that this acquisition has come just at the right moment when WordPress itself is going through a huge amount of change,&#8221; Perel said. &#8220;With the release of Gutenberg and the new built-in post editor we realized that much of Layers would need to change in order to keep pace with the new look of WordPress and feel that <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://layerswp.us10.list-manage.com/track/click?u=5b9a020fcf797987098cc7bca&id=c493b36eaa&e=4441ba6d29\" target=\"_blank\">Elementor</a> is the best company to respond to the shifting tide of the industry.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Layers&#8217; Theme Collection Is Now Free and Fully Compatible with Elementor</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Elementor has released all 11 of <a href=\"https://www.layerswp.com/product-category/themes/\">Layers&#8217; themes</a> for free and Ben Pines said they are considering listing them on WordPress.org to make it easier for users to find them and stay updated. All of the themes have been updated to be fully compatible with both Gutenberg and Elementor. Existing Layers&#8217; customers will receive two months of support before support is handed over to the Layers user community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Updating themes for compatibility is no easy matter, and we get thousands of requests asking for a theme that is compatible with Elementor,&#8221; Pines said. Finding a theme that is fully compatible with the page builder can be challenging. Pines said users often decide to use Elementor first and then look for a theme. There&#8217;s even a Facebook group called <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/126645814685793/?ref=br_rs\">Elementor + Which Theme?</a> with more than 2,400 members.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Themes still pose an issue for users,&#8221; Elementor&#8217;s head of business development, Zvi Shapira, said. &#8220;We saw value in continuing the Layers project, and not leaving thousands of Layers users without a home. Layers is a well worthy project, and offering a theme that is compatible with Elementor and Gutenberg for free for our users and for all WordPress users has great value.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pines identified Layers&#8217; advanced Customizer panel as one of its chief selling points. Along with the acquisition, all of the Layers Pro features, such as resizing the logo, customizing buttons, and styling menus, are now rolled into the free version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg is forcing some consolidation among page builders, as smaller operations struggle to keep pace with the technical updates required. Gutenberg is expected to standardize a way of layout building further along in the site customization phase. Pines said his team isn&#8217;t worried about how that will impact Elementor, even if core ends up overlapping with some of the solutions they offer in the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I really don&#8217;t know if there will be an impact and of what sort,&#8221; Pines said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like the blocks we developed for Gutenberg. We adapted to provide our users with the maximum flexibility.&#8221; The plugin ensures that users don&#8217;t have to choose between using Gutenberg and the page builder. Acquiring Layers&#8217; theme collection means Elementor users no longer have to look so hard to find a compatible theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our hope is that Layers themes will help less tech-savvy users manage the entire site design hassle-free,&#8221; Pines said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Jan 2019 23:29:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"Dev Blog: WordPress 5.0.3 Maintenance Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6530\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:71:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/wordpress-5-0-3-maintenance-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4566:\"<p>WordPress 5.0.3 is now available!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>5.0.3 is a maintenance release that includes 37 bug fixes and 7 performance updates.

The new era of &#8220;Happy Publishing&#8221; in 2019 will bring even more progress on that roadmap, enabling users to have a more unified editing experience for other aspects of content management, including <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2018/12/08/9-priorities-for-2019/\">widgets and menus</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br /><br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 23:44:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:42;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:63:\"WPTavern: GitHub Announces Free, Unlimited Private Repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86657\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wptavern.com/github-announces-free-unlimited-private-repositories\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3488:\"<p>GitHub users no longer have to pay to keep code private. The company is now offering <a href=\"https://blog.github.com/2019-01-07-new-year-new-github/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">unlimited private repositories to Free account users</a>, with up to three collaborators. Developers have different reasons for wanting to keep their code private &#8211; it may not be ready, they may be working on a side project, or may just be starting out in their coding journey. GitHub now makes it possible for users with free accounts to do that work in private, without having to upgrade to a Pro account for $7/month.</p>\n<p>This change brings the code hosting site more in line with competitors like GitLab.com, which allows for unlimited private projects and collaborators, and Bitbucket, a platform that has offered this for much longer. Bitbucket was actually <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4428278\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">GitLab&#8217;s inspiration for this model</a>. </p>\n<p>GitHub&#8217;s announcement was well-received but for many who have already moved to GitLab, this news come too late. Some are also wary of giving GitHub access to their private projects after Microsoft acquired the company for $7.5 billion last year. However, GitHub seems to be focusing its efforts less on monetizing the small fish and more on evolving the company&#8217;s Enterprise offering. It has combined its Business Cloud and Enterprise products into one unified &#8220;GitHub Enterprise&#8221; product that starts at $21/user/month.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Of course the GitHub update is so bigmega giantcorp can get you to give them more info &amp; in turn more power &amp; in turn more money, if that\'s annoying &amp;/or unsavory to you there are alternatives (that are less convenient but that\'s what this is all about anyway) no grump just fact</p>\n<p>&mdash; Jon Christopher (@jchristopher) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jchristopher/status/1082353226329001985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 7, 2019</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>&#8220;At GitLab we think that repositories will become a commodity,&#8221; GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij <a href=\"https://about.gitlab.com/2019/01/07/github-offering-free-private-repos-for-up-to-three-collaborators/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">said</a> in reaction to GitHub&#8217;s announcement. &#8220;I think Microsoft will try to generate more revenue with people using Azure more instead of paying for repos. We&#8217;re focusing on making a single application for the entire DevOps lifecycle that can replace a lot of other tools.&#8221;  </p>\n<p>Every inch given in this space makes code sharing platforms more competitive. In terms of private repositories, GitHub has come close to offering what its smaller competitors have been giving away for free for a long time. If GitHub were to add Continuous Integration (CI) for free users to match GitLab&#8217;s free tier, for example, it might capture even more of the market. Different features sway different types of users to adopt one platform or another and eventually some of those turn into paying customers.</p>\n<p>For existing GitHub Free users, unlimited private repositories means the opportunity to keep their incomplete projects out of the public eye, instead of having people stumble on them and wonder why they don&#8217;t work as expected. It also frees up a few more dollars for Pro users who want to downgrade to Free accounts.  </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 08 Jan 2019 18:46:55 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Dev Blog: The Month in WordPress: December 2018\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=6527\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2019/01/the-month-in-wordpress-december-2018/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3528:\"<p>New features, a big event, and important announcements marked December as a milestone month for the WordPress community. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>Release of WordPress 5.0</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On December 6 <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2018/12/bebo/\">WordPress 5.0 was released</a>.

It is not clear what actions will be within the realm of possibility with the current benevolent dictator model WordPress has used. Part of the scope of the project is to &#8220;propose a leadership and governance model for the WordPress open source project and its communities.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">That\'s part of the job: to figure out how it can and should work.

The second aspect of the project that aims to get WordPress a seat at the table seems more feasible and more likely to be well-received by the project&#8217;s leadership. It might make more sense to split up the two objectives into different projects. WordPress&#8217; internal governance and its role in the greater web are very different topics, but the project&#8217;s creators seem to view them as inseparable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt Mullenweg hasn&#8217;t joined in the Twitter conversation about governance but he did address the topic on a recent <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/matt-mullenweg-on-gutenberg/\">Post Status podcast episode</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;When he was talking about open governance, my take was that he was talking about getting WordPress a seat at the table, and discussing these regulation changes and et cetera happening,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I think the example last year was that there was this meeting at 10 Downing Street. Who was there? Was WordPress represented?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;And he started talking about the Web Foundation, and I began thinking, “Wow, WordPress only represents a third of websites, and not even, really. It’s a third of the top 10 million. Another foundation like the Web Foundation actually might be a better vehicle to try to advocate on the open Web as a whole, versus just the people who happen to be using a single CMS.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When asked more about WordPress&#8217; leadership structure, Mullenweg reviewed the different approaches he has taken with the project. In 2018, the expression of his BDFL-style leadership was manifestly more overt than previous years, which may have influenced or even inspired the creation of the WordPress Governance Project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s been a lot more leaders, but I would actually argue the point that WordPress has always been sort of my vision being set, or even my direct leadership,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;There was a good four or five years there where the leadership structure, because we’ve experimented with lots of different &#8211; we don’t call it governance &#8211; but essentially leadership structures in WordPress. For a while, we had kind of the … It wasn’t a committee approach, but essentially like the lead developers consensus approach. We did that for a few years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Even from the beginning it wasn’t just me. It was me and Mike Little, so it’s never been solo. Then we went to where the release lead was the final decider, including over me, so that was probably, I don’t know, 3.9 to 4.7 maybe, that included overruling me as project lead for what was in the release or not, and that was to try to give a little more autonomy and flexibility to release leads. But the big change was a few years ago I said, &#8216;Okay, I’m going to take back over core WordPress development,&#8217; and that was to try to make some of these big changes happen. So right now it is much more of a benevolent dictator model, although both of those words are questionable. But, I don’t see that as the permanent forever structure.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg may not be able to sustain this level of involvement in core leadership indefinitely, with all of his other responsibilities at Automattic. He said he is open to WordPress empowering other leaders in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m not saying it always has to be me, but what I want is a strong, opinionated, thoughtful leader setting a bold direction, taking experiments and being willing to fail, comfortable with failure, is I think what you need to create great software,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian DeConinck, a WordPress developer who has recently been a vocal critic of the project&#8217;s leadership, called for more transparency around the decision-making process in his <a href=\"http://www.briandeconinck.com/initial-thoughts-wordpress-governance/\">initial thoughts on the governance project.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Matt is the central figure of the WordPress project,&#8221; DeConinck said. &#8220;He’s been a guiding force since the beginning. Without a doubt, he’s an important and valued member of our community. I don’t imagine governance as a means of usurping him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;But should there be a single human face at the head of a project and a community at this scale? When people are critical of decision-making, having Matt at the center makes it easy to make criticism needlessly personal. This dynamic is hard on Matt and others in the project leadership, and ultimately toxic for the community.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeConinck said in order for the governance project to be successful he thinks it needs to be international, multicultural, and multilingual, with diverse voices, as well as clear mechanisms for WordPress users to provide feedback. He outlined a detailed list of success criteria that hasn&#8217;t officially been embraced by governance project as it has yet to hold its first meeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>DeConinck&#8217;s suggestions are incompatible with the current BDFL-style leadership, as he claims that &#8220;feedback from a community of millions of users can’t adequately be processed and acted upon by a single individual listening and making decisions for the project.&#8221; WordPress has risen to become a dominant force on the web during the past 15 years under this style of leadership. Any meaningful proposal of change to the leadership structure will need to demonstrate how the new model can continue to enable WordPress to make rapid progress and maintain its relevance on the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>WordPress Governance Project Flagged as Unofficial and Removed from WordPress.org</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Earlier this morning, WordPress Community Team representative Francesca Marano <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2019/01/07/wordpress-governance-project-change-of-venue/\">posted a notice</a> on behalf of the governance project&#8217;s leadership to announce that the project has been removed from WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Concerns have been raised about the posting of news about the WordPress Governance Project on make.wordpress.org and use of the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/tag/community-team/\">#community-team</a> Slack channel giving the impression the project is sanctioned as an official WordPress project,&#8221; Marano said. &#8220;It has not received such sanctions from WordPress leadership.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We went through what we believed were the appropriate channels for launching the project through the Community group (ie speaking to group members, asking for access to the Make blog, coordinating with the team and others to find a meeting time which didn’t collide with others, etc),&#8221; Morten Rand-Hendriksen said. &#8220;We were later informed the project was not sanctioned by WordPress leadership and therefore cannot use the Make blog or Slack.&#8221; He would not comment further on what transpired or the communication his team received.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the time being, it looks like the governance project will need to prove its worth independently before being officially adopted by WordPress. Many other community-led efforts and tools have followed this same process before coming under the umbrella of core. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project now has its own dedicated website at <a href=\"https://wpgovernance.com/\">wpgovernance.com</a> and a Slack instance at <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/twgp/signup?x=x-517030675360-517548723457\">twgp.slack.com</a>. The first meeting was set for January 8 but has been postponed to January, 15, 1600 UTC to allow participants to sign up at the new Slack workspace.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Jan 2019 19:49:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"WPTavern: Beaver Builder Doubles Down on Serving Power Users in Response to Gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86569\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wptavern.com/beaver-builder-doubles-down-on-serving-power-users-in-response-to-gutenberg\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3074:\"<p>At WordCamp US I had the opportunity to chat with <a href=\"https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/\">Beaver Builder</a> co-founder Robby McCullough about how the page builder is navigating the Gutenberg era. The proliferation of blocks for the new editor has made it easy for non-technical WordPress users to add things like pricing tables, maps, tabs, accordions, and other UI elements. Future iterations of Gutenberg will soon tackle layouts. These improvements to core will radically change how page builder products are marketed to WordPress users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One of the decisions we made in response to the news of Gutenberg early on is that we wanted to double down on our professional power users,&#8221; McCullough said. &#8220;It took us a long time in our growth as a business to figure out who our customers were. We realized there were two distinct camps: one that was like a do-it-yourselfer type, someone who maybe had a small business or a hobby website who wanted to use WordPress but wasn&#8217;t familiar with writing code. The other was more of a freelancer &#8211; maybe a one or two person agency, people who were building lots of websites and had development and frontend skills. We see that as the space where we want to live now. We&#8217;re hoping to continue solving problems and making the experience better for folks with a few more skills in their tool belts.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Following up with McCullough later, he said that applying this new direction to Beaver Builder is already translating into the features they are prioritizing for the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For example, in our latest major release, we added percent, em, rem, and viewport-based units for things like font sizes, margins, and padding,&#8221; McCullough said. &#8220;Without a basic understanding of CSS, this feature wouldn&#8217;t be too helpful. We also added dozens of pre-built row templates. So, instead of creating single-page designs, our goal was to create a modular system of rows that can be mixed and matched to build out sites. We&#8217;re working to build features that better enable folks who build lots of websites.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interview below we discussed the current integration between Gutenberg and Beaver Builder. McCullough said his team is considering bringing blocks into Beaver Builder or bringing Beaver Builder content into Gutenberg; both are possibilities. His team has been waiting to see how quickly the community adopts Gutenberg before making any major decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My hope is that there&#8217;s still going to be a place for page builders, Beaver Builder and everyone in this space, to have a little bit more agility,&#8221; McCullough said. &#8220;We can see Gutenberg kind of be like Instagram in that it&#8217;s going to appeal to a mass audience. We like to live in the Photoshop space where you&#8217;re going to get a lot of fine-tuned controls, solving problems and creating features that are going to help people build websites every day.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Jan 2019 20:20:37 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WPTavern: WP Storybook: A Handy Reference for WordPress React UI Components\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:29:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=86604\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-storybook-a-handy-reference-for-wordpress-react-ui-components\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1553:\"<p><a href=\"https://lubus.in/\">LUBUS</a>, a web design agency in Mumbai, has published a site called <a href=\"https://wp-storybook.netlify.com/\">WP Storybook</a> that offers an interactive way to explore various WordPress React components.

The campaign is focused around the question: &#8220;What Would You Do If You Could Do Anything?&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress.com published its inaugural <a href=\"https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2019/01/03/introducing-the-2019-anything-is-possible-list/\">‘Anything Is Possible’ List</a>, which includes 10 mini-documentaries ranging from 1 minute to 1:44. A few of the stories highlighted include Congolese-American sisters operating a successful hair salon in NYC, a 12-year-old journalist running her own online publication, a blogger who went viral and published her own book, and a non-profit fighting misinformation and extremist narratives. Each is presented more in depth on a new <a href=\"https://wordpress.com/do-anything/\">Do Anything</a> campaign site that was launched today.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Do Anything is WordPress.com&#8217;s first large-scale national brand campaign. It will debut TV, print, and digital advertising spots in The New Yorker and on TV networks, including The History Channel, CNN, and National Geographic. WordPress.com will also be running ads on podcasts, including The Daily and NPR. The new 30-second TV ad was created by <a href=\"http://interestingdevelopment.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Interesting Development</a>, an agency based in New York.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Much like gym memberships, WordPress.com tends to see more action at the beginning of a new year with 20% more sites are created in January than the average, according to Mark Armstrong at Automattic. The timing for the campaign is aimed at tapping into the motivation that millions of users have for starting a new business or blog at this time of year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, Automattic started <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2016/01/marketing-at-automattic/\">hiring for more marketing positions</a> as an answer to Wix, Weebly, Squarespace, Web.com, EIG, and Godaddy, competitors that Matt Mullenweg identified as having spent over $350M in advertising that year. In 2017, the company created <a href=\"https://design.blog/2017/05/18/how-a-detroit-hackathon-turned-into-wordpress-coms-first-ever-tv-spots/\">five commercials</a>, its first ever TV spots, as part of a series called &#8220;Free to be.&#8221; Many found the commercials to be confusing and the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-coms-tv-commercials-are-confusing\">messaging wasn&#8217;t clear</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By contrast, the 2019 &#8220;Do Anything&#8221; campaign is much better at demonstrating what people can do with WordPress.  &#8220;As we share new work with the world we realize that some things will hit and some things will miss,&#8221; Automattic’s SVP of Brand, Michelle Broderick said. The company has continued to evolve its marketing based on feedback. This particular campaign was directly inspired by the people who are making things happen with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We were inspired by the people who use WordPress to imagine a better world,&#8221; Broderick said. &#8220;We saw everyone from bloggers to business owners to scientists to politicians using WordPress to share their story.&#8221;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The new TV spot is an improvement over previous campaigns in terms of communicating a clear message, but it doesn&#8217;t carry the same authenticity as the mini-documentaries. Each one is relatable and inspiring in telling the stories of people who have already answered the question &#8220;What would you do if you could do anything?&#8221; Many of those who were featured have carried on with their dreams through perseverance, despite tragedy and struggle along the way. The documentaries are more poignant than the TV spot, which has the added constraint of having to capture the viewer&#8217;s attention with a shorter amount of time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The &#8220;Do Anything&#8221; campaign as a whole is a good representation of the power of WordPress and should also help boost name recognition for the software in general. Broderick said Automattic is expecting tens of millions of impressions across TV, print, digital, and podcasts. The campaign is aimed at the American market but Armstrong said they hope to branch out into international markets in the future.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Jan 2019 20:05:22 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"HeroPress: YOU Make The Difference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=2672\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:120:\"https://heropress.com/essays/you-make-the-difference/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=you-make-the-difference\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10124:\"<img width=\"960\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://s20094.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/010219-min-1024x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: WordPress still attracts the same types of people. Those who are brave, who are kind, who are looking to the future.\" /><blockquote><p>“A place is only as good as the people you know in it. It&#8217;s the people that make the place.”</p>\n<p>― Pittacus Lore, I Am Number Four</p></blockquote>\n<p>This quote is a large part of the space WordPress holds within me.</p>\n<p>Coming from a career in Civil Engineering and a background of Industrial Technology WordPress as a software drew me as a tool. It was a means to an end. I wasn’t blogging, I wasn’t looking to create an online voice, I was looking to build something and I needed a tool.</p>\n<p>I was good at learning software, had used over a dozen very complicated systems by that point in my life, so I found WordPress and started learning it too.</p>\n<p>A very melodramatic discovery story of WordPress for a HeroPress piece, I know.</p>\n<p>The truth is I probably wouldn’t have stuck around were it not for the people. The story has evolved for me over the years but that’s the beginning. The beginnings are usually far less romantic than the endings in any story.</p>\n<p>So why was I looking for a tool? Well, that’s a bit better of a story.</p>\n<h3>Looking For A Tool</h3>\n<p>I’ll prep you with the fact that I was driven, opinionated, blunt, and defensive. I had spent my college years and first years in my chosen career in a male-dominated industry. I learned how to navigate and thrive and took a job at a very large Engineering firm. About a year in I was granted a fantastic opportunity to work on a small startup team that was doing amazing work in 3D scanning.</p>\n<p>Being a startup team demanded that we produce more and more work to determine the viability of the investment the firm was making in my boss’s plans. As we worked on landing deals that required overnight travel and training that required days away it brought to the surface a reality that wasn’t so good for me. As the only woman on the team, I doubled the travel budget. They needed two of everything for me since I couldn’t bunk up with my male coworkers.</p>\n<p>The next months were a perfect storm of events. I made an opinionated comment to a division supervisor that was above my pay grade which enhanced my visibility as a problem. Then I got pregnant.</p>\n<blockquote><p>You can’t walk around 3D scanning a PVC manufacturing facility while with child. They also don’t make maternity coveralls.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I was officially dead weight. I lost the pregnancy and became depressed, anxious. It was easy for them to let me go then, I had stopped being productive. I found out a couple weeks after losing my job I was pregnant again. Talk about a whirlwind.</p>\n<p>My husband was in the process of changing careers from Retail to Healthcare and maternity leave is not something you like to bring up on an interview, so I decided to find something to do from home. I started a local family newsletter and decided to create an online marketplace for moms who craft out of their homes, like a local Etsy. This is where my search for a tool began.</p>\n<h3>Starting Again</h3>\n<p>A few months later, with no WordPress experience other than what I managed to rake together while I was learning and building, I got a job at WPMUDEV doing product support. I needed the extra cash so my other projects took a backseat and I was soon completely engulfed. Through that job, I came to learn about the ecosystem that was WordPress. I had no idea that there was a place that existed outside of the corporate universe that could exist without sexist politics, hierarchy, and status quo. It was mind-blowing.</p>\n<p>I was so hungry for people to interact with after being in such a team-oriented environment for so long. I loved working with others and I felt very alone until I found this great group of people. And oh what joy when I found it! I was a new mom at home with a baby trying to learn how to handle that new space in my life. My husband had completed a successful career change and we had moved. I had another baby. I met my friend Mason and we started a business together. I lost another pregnancy.</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the space of two short years, my life had completely turned upside down and landed me in the place that would help me survive it all.</p></blockquote>\n<p>You see, without the people, I wouldn’t have made it. I wouldn’t have been able to navigate the overwhelming waters that surrounded me outside of my day to day work. The people who befriended me, who were kind to me, who made jokes with me, who valued my contribution and intelligence without ever having set eyes on me, those were the people who kept me sane. They let me see I didn’t need to be defensive, that I didn’t have to be sorry about being opinionated, that I was different and that I should lean into that.</p>\n<p>When I left product support to work with Mason at, what was formerly called, WP Valet it was yet another major shift in my life. The product space was so different than the agency space and I quickly adapted to the new pace. There was a rush of excitement while learning new things and applying skills that had laid dormant for some time. My father was a Navy man and an entrepreneur and shaped so much of how I applied myself, now I was in a place to push myself even further and define my own path. I was spoiled by my first interactions at WP Valet with developers like Zé Fontainhas and Mario Peshev. The whole thing was thrilling!</p>\n<h3>And Then I Went To WordCamp</h3>\n<p>My first WordCamp was WordCamp Miami 2013. It was probably the first time I’d traveled alone in some time and I was meeting my work family for the first time. On top of that, I was in MIAMI, so it was bound to be a great trip. I got to meet David Bisset and Lisa Sabin Wilson that year, and so many other wonderful people. I was on cloud 9, each and every personality was inspiring to me, all so different than what my former colleagues and field specialists were like. To top it off I walked into my first talk at a WordCamp, Pippin Wilson was talking about how developers should share code. I was beside myself, sharing your code and supporting each other? Not cutthroat over projects and billable hours?! I was swooning over the idea of ‘community’ and what I had stumbled into.</p>\n<blockquote><p>Needless to say, I left 100% hooked on my path. WordPress was my life from that time on.</p></blockquote>\n<p>We as people have long-tailed stories that weave and zigzag and turn back on themselves. We are products of ALL the things going on in our lives at any given moment. Without the personal struggles and the professional push, I would not have been able to value the community as much as I do. The overlapping of personal and professional trials and successes are what gives depth to our experiences. Their overlapping is what colors the story of our lives.</p>\n<p>Fast forward a few years through a cross-state move, speaking selections, the birth of another child, a company expansion, another pregnancy loss, a company rebranding, a company restructuring, a return to school for Yoga training, and all the other things life throws in your path with family and work and here I sit typing my story at my counter while my middle child hums ‘Mamma Mia’ next to me. I am forever grateful for the life that I’ve been able to live through a whole new career in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>You Make The Difference</h3>\n<p>I am grateful for every soul I have met. I had the privilege to work with and become friendly with some of the nicest and most genuine people I will ever meet online and face to face. The ecosystem of WP has changed a lot over the years as most ecosystems do, but it still attracts the same types of people. Those who are brave, who are kind, who are looking to the future. My world is so much bigger because of all you.

He asked me to revisit the WordPress mission, “Democratize Publishing,” and reflect on what that mission means to me today. So here you go, Toru: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For many years, my definition of “Democratize Publishing” has been simply to help make the web a more open place. That foundation begins with the software itself, as outlined by the <a href=\"https://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/\">Four Freedoms</a>: <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>0. The freedom to run the program, for any purpose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>1. The freedom to study how the program works, and change it so it does your computing as you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2. The freedom to redistribute copies so you can help your neighbor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>3. The freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions, giving the community a chance to benefit from your changes.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the mission of “Democratize Publishing” to me means that people of all backgrounds, interests, and abilities should be able to access Free-as-in-speech software that empowers them to express themselves on the open web and to own their content.<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as Toru noted in the original question, “Democratize Publishing” has come to mean many things to many people in the WordPress community. That’s one reason I like it. The WordPress mission is not just for one person to define. <br /></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I’d like to ask everyone: What does “Democratize Publishing” mean to you? &nbsp;<br /></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 27 Dec 2018 00:06:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"Matt\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 05:16:40 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Wed, 13 Feb 2019 05:00:09 GMT\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 1\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20190212142806\";}', 'no');

Creating a dedicated form landing page in WordPress is a great way to save time, generate more leads, and boost form conversions.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to create dedicated form landing pages in WordPress using WPForms.</p>\n<h3>What Are the Benefits of a Form Landing Page?</h3>\n<p>Having a custom form landing page has many benefits. Not to be confused with a standalone webpage, a form landing page is a page your site visitors land on from either internal or external links.</p>\n<p>Take a look at some of the best reasons to have a form landing page on your WordPress site:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/research-based-tips-to-improve-contact-form-conversions/\">Increase Conversions</a>:</strong> A lot of times people don’t finish filling out online forms because there are too many distractions. Multiple offers pull site visitors away from subscribing to your email list. But if there is nothing on the page except your online form, people are more likely to sign up.</li>\n<li><strong>Spread Brand Awareness:</strong> Since WPForms lets you create a custom form landing page, complete with a company logo and customized color schemes, you build more brand awareness and recognition among site visitors, which in turn will help you grow your small business.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Customization:</strong> When you have a dedicated landing page, you are in control of customizing how it looks. This is much different than traditional web form layouts, which are controlled by your WordPress theme and may prevent you from customizing your form the way you want.</li>\n<li><strong>No Need for Separate Webpages:</strong> There will be times when you have a form for people to fill out, but don’t want to create an entirely separate WordPress page that shows up in your navigation menu. With a dedicated form landing page, you create a custom landing page with your form on it, without having to build separate webpages.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Whether your main goal is lead generation, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/best-wordpress-membership-plugins-compared/\">creating a membership site</a>, giving people an easy way to RSVP to events, or <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/create-a-survey-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/\">gauging customer loyalty with survey forms</a>, creating a distraction free landing page for your online forms is a great idea.</p>\n<p>Now, let’s see how to create a dedicated landing form page in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a New Form in WordPress</h3>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms plugin</a>.

But first, let’s take a quick look at the general form settings you should configure before creating your custom form landing page.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Form Settings</h3>\n<p>There are many settings to configure once you’ve customized your form to look the way you want it to.</p>\n<p><strong>General Settings</strong><br />\nTo start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can change things like your form’s name, description, and submit button copy.</p>\n<p>You can also <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-spam-free-wordpress-contact-forms-the-ultimate-guide/\">enable additional spam prevention features</a> to <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a> from unwanted form submissions.</p>\n<p><strong>Form Notifications</strong><br />\nNotifications are a great way to send an email whenever a form is submitted on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Unless you disable this feature, whenever someone submits a form on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>If you need to send more than one notification, for example to yourself, a team member, and your site visitor, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition, if you want to keep branding across your emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Form Confirmations</strong><br />\nForm confirmations are messages that display to site visitors once they submit a form on your website.

This is good for letting people know what your landing page is all about. It also lets them know what action you want them to take while there.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-379744\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-pages-title.png\" alt=\"form pages title\" width=\"562\" height=\"184\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-pages-title.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-pages-title-300x98.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Next, you can add a short message for your site visitors to see. This gives you a chance to add some additional information so people know what to expect when they fill out your form.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-379738\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-page-description.png\" alt=\"form page description\" width=\"562\" height=\"285\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-page-description.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-page-description-300x152.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Permalink</strong></p>\n<p>Whenever you enable form page mode, the Form Pages addon automatically creates a unique permalink for you.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-379739\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-page-permalink.png\" alt=\"form page permalink\" width=\"562\" height=\"92\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-page-permalink.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/form-page-permalink-300x49.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You can change this permalink if you want, or leave it.</p>\n<p>This is the URL you’ll use in email campaigns, internal linking, and even social media posts when you want people to visit your custom form landing page and convert.</p>\n<p><strong>Header Logo</strong></p>\n<p>The next thing you can do to customize your dedicated form landing page is add a logo. Click on <strong>Upload Image</strong> and choose the image you want to add to your form landing page.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-379741\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/header-logo.png\" alt=\"header logo\" width=\"562\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/header-logo.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/header-logo-300x96.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><strong>Footer Text and Branding</strong></p>\n<p>You have the option of adding some footer text to the bottom of your form landing page.

Email campaigns are a great way to stay in touch with site visitors once they leave your website.</p>\n<p>Here are some other benefits of email marketing:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Increase Sales:</strong> Email campaigns are the perfect way to get people to come to your website and buy. Plus, email is known for outperforming both social and organic search traffic.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost Repeat Visits:</strong> <a href=\"https://neilpatel.com/blog/what-converting-websites-do/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">96% of people</a> who come to your website aren’t ready to buy on their first visit. But if you can get them to subscribe before they leave, you have another chance to encourage them to come back and make a purchase.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a Loyal Following:</strong> Repeat visitors to your website are more likely to convert when compared to first-time visitors.

Plus, it’s going to help you increase form conversions and make more money, which is what every small business owner wants right?</p>\n<p>So, let’s see what WPForms 1.5.1 has in store for you!</p>\n<h3>Form Builder Education</h3>\n<p>Have you ever used WPForms and wished it had a feature, only to find out it was there all along?</p>\n<p>That can be frustrating and make you feel like you’re not getting the most out of a product you’ve paid for.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we’ve created a way for you to know what features are available, while in the form builder itself.</p>\n<p>And to make things even easier on you (which may not seem possible at this point) we’ve created a way for you to install and activate any WPForms addon <strong>without ever leaving the form builder</strong>.</p>\n<p>Anytime you’re configuring your form’s settings, and you come across a feature you&#8217;re not actively using, it will appear grayed out in the form builder.</p>\n<p>This is our way of telling you that you aren’t using one of WPForms’ awesome features.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367408\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/inactive-wpforms-features.png\" alt=\"inactive wpforms features\" width=\"562\" height=\"500\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/inactive-wpforms-features.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/inactive-wpforms-features-300x267.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If you decide you want to use a feature that&#8217;s not enabled, just click on it. You’ll see a popup asking you if want to activate it. All you have to do is click “Yes, Activate” and that feature will be ready to use on your forms.</p>\n<p>Simple as that.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-367406\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-addon-in-form-builder.png\" alt=\"activate addon in form builder\" width=\"562\" height=\"332\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-addon-in-form-builder.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/activate-addon-in-form-builder-300x177.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>And guess what? The same thing happens when you’re adding form fields to your form.</p>\n<p>Want to add a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/beginners-guide-what-is-a-likert-scale-and-how-to-use-it/\" title=\"Beginner’s Guide: What is a Likert Scale and How to Use It?\">Likert Scale</a> to your form? No problem. Click on the grayed out form field, install and activate the Surveys and Polls addon, and add a Likert Scale to your form within seconds.</p>\n<p>Our hope is that by adding form building education to our plugin, you&#8217;ll discover features you never knew existed, save yourself time and prevent errors, and feel confident that WPForms is the best investment you could have made for your small business.</p>\n<h3>Plugin Translations</h3>\n<p>Right now, English is the number one used language on the internet. But that doesn’t mean there aren’t other popular languages being used on the web too.</p>\n<p>Some website owners prefer to use WordPress in their native language. But the problem is, if your site’s plugins aren’t translated, that means they’re still in English. This creates inconsistencies across your site’s interface and makes site creation harder than it needs to be.</p>\n<p>In an effort to globalize WPForms, and create an easier workflow when it comes to form building, we’ve fully translated the WPForms plugin into the top requested languages:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Spanish</li>\n<li>Japanese</li>\n<li>German</li>\n<li>Italian</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-368706\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/translated-wpforms-templates.png\" alt=\"translated wpforms templates\" width=\"562\" height=\"329\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/translated-wpforms-templates.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/translated-wpforms-templates-300x176.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Don’t see your native language?</p>\n<p>Don’t worry, we’re going to continue our efforts to increase WPForms&#8217; global presence and offer more language translations throughout the year, so be on the lookout!</p>\n<h3>Payment Checkboxes</h3>\n<p>One of your most requested payment features is finally here: <strong>payment checkboxes</strong>!</p>\n<p>Up until now, if you wanted to give people the option to choose more than one purchase item, you&#8217;ve had to add multiple form fields to your order form.</p>\n<p>But did you know that removing as little as one form field has the potential to increase form conversions by as <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/online-form-statistics-facts/\">much as 26%</a>?</p>\n<p>Do away with cluttered, lengthy, and complicated order forms by using our newest form field instead.</p>\n<p>With it, you can give your customers the option to choose more than one purchase item at a time – <strong>from one form field</strong>.</p>\n<p>Plus, you can increase form completions, improve your customers&#8217; buying experience, and make more money.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-367410\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/payment-checkboxes.gif\" alt=\"payment checkboxes\" width=\"562\" height=\"270\" /></p>\n<p>And don’t forget, the less form fields you have to add to your order form, the less work you have to do.</p>\n<p>So, what are you waiting for?</p>\n<p>Check out our newest release and let us know what you think about the new features we’ve included.</p>\n<p>As always, thank you for your continued support of WPForms, and we look forward to helping you create better online forms.</p>\n<p><em>Lindsay and the WPForms team</em></p>\n<p>P.S.

Does your child or Girl Scout troop need an efficient way to sell more cookies? There are many ways to be a top-selling Girl Scout, and it just so happens that having an online order form for customers to fill out is one of the best ways.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll share how to create a Girl Scout Cookie order form in WordPress using WPForms.</p>\n<h3>How to Sell the Most Girl Scout Cookies</h3>\n<p>There are about <a href=\"https://www.girlscouts.org/en/about-girl-scouts/who-we-are/facts.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">1.8 million active Girl Scouts</a> in the United States. Of those active members, about half of them sell Girl Scout Cookies each season in an effort to raise money for their local troop and council.</p>\n<p>But if your daughter is a part of Girl Scouts and wants to be a top-seller, how can you help her compete?</p>\n<p>Here are some of the best ways to help your daughter become a top-selling Girl Scout this cookie season:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Be Proactive.</strong> Cookie season happens every year at the same time. If your daughter wants to start the season off with a bang, have her prepare early by scheduling booth times and creating signage before the season kicks off. You can also have her let people know it’s almost time to buy again.</li>\n<li><strong>Set Goals.</strong> As the cookie season approaches, have your Girl Scout make goals for herself that she can strive to meet. Then, have her spread the word about her goals so people know what she needs to meet her goal. This will help hold her accountable and make her work harder if she has an end goal in mind.</li>\n<li><strong>Always Have Extras.</strong> Sometimes people don’t know it’s Girl Scout Cookie season until they see your daughter in her uniform with cookies in hand. That’s why having extras boxes on hand as she delivers the goods is helpful. Any extra box your daughter can sell puts her one more box closer to her goal.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Lastly, have your daughter take advantage of the power of the internet.</p>\n<p>The easier your Girl Scout makes things on customers, the more cookies she’ll be able to sell. At the in-person booths, people are often required to pay in cash, which makes things hard for some people.</p>\n<p>With <a href=\"https://wpforms.com\">WPForms</a>, you can create a Girl Scout Cookie order form in WordPress and enjoy the following benefits:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Give people 24/7 access to cookies so they can buy whenever the mood strikes, regardless of whether there’s a booth nearby.</li>\n<li>Integrate your Girl Scout Cookie order form with <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/stripe-addon/\">Stripe</a> or <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/paypal-standard-addon/\">PayPal</a>, giving people an easy way to pay right away.</li>\n<li>Easily manage all form submissions from one place on the backend of your site so you and your daughter always know who has placed an order.</li>\n<li>Enable survey reporting so you can see how many of each cookie type you’ll need come delivery time.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-an-aweber-signup-checkbox-to-your-contact-form/\">Add a newsletter checkbox</a> to the Girl Scout Cookie order form so people can subscribe to the official Girl Scouts of America newsletter and always know what’s going on, especially when it comes to the cookies.</li>\n<li>Display form confirmations and send email notifications so customers know their orders have been processed and their cookies are on the way.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, now that you know how to help your daughter become a top-selling Girl Scout, and how WPForms can help, let’s see how to create a Girl Scout Cookie order form in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create a Girl Scout Cookie Order Form in WordPress</h3>\n<p>Using WPForms is the easiest way to create a Girl Scout Cookie order form in WordPress.

You can also click on a form field and drag it to rearrange the order on your Girl Scout Cookie order form.</p>\n<p>When your online Girl Scout Cookie order form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your Girl Scout Cookie Order Form Settings</h3>\n<p>To start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can configure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Name.</strong> Rename your form here.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Description.</strong> Give your form a description.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Button Text.</strong> Customize the copy on the submit button. For instance, you can change the button to say “Buy Cookies.”</li>\n<li><strong>Spam Prevention.</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-a-spam-free-contact-form-without-captcha/\">Enable the anti-spam honeypot feature</a> to prevent spam cookie orders and <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a>. This feature is automatically enabled on all WordPress forms. If you decide to use another form of spam prevention, you can either unclick this option or continue using this feature with other spam prevention features such as recaptcha.</li>\n<li><strong>GDPR Enhancements.</strong> You can disable the storing of entry information and user details, such as IP addresses and user agents, in an effort to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-gdpr-compliant-forms/\">comply with GDPR requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Girl Scout Cookie Order Form Notifications</h3>\n<p>Notifications are a great way to send an email whenever someone buys Girl Scout Cookies on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, unless you disable this feature, whenever someone submits a Girl Scout Cookie order form on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">use smart tags</a>, you can also send a notification to your customers when they buy cookies from your Girl Scout, letting them know you two have received their order and will be in contact shortly. This assures people their order has gone through properly.</p>\n<p>You can also add important information to the notification about their cookie order. For instance, provide payment options if you choose to collect payment at the time of delivery, estimated delivery dates, and how to get in touch with you if they need anything else with their order.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>You can send more than one notification when someone buys Girl Scout Cookies on your site. For instance, you can send a notification to yourself, your customers, and your daughter’s troop leader.</p>\n<p>For help doing this, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want to keep branding across your emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Your Girl Scout Cookie Order Form Confirmations</h3>\n<p>Form confirmations are messages that display to people once they submit a Girl Scout Cookie order form on your website. They let people know that their order has gone through and offer you the chance to let them know what the next steps are.</p>\n<p>WPForms has three confirmation types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong> This is the default confirmation type in WPForms. When someone submits an online Girl Scout Cookie order form, a simple message confirmation will appear letting them know their order was received and is being processed.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Page.</strong> This confirmation type will take customers to a specific web page on your site thanking them for their cookie order. For help doing this, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-redirect-users-after-wordpress-form-submit/\">redirecting customers to a thank you page</a>. In addition, be sure to check out our article on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/4-thank-you-page-examples-to-boost-customer-loyalty/\">creating effective Thank You pages</a> for boosting customer loyalty.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to URL (Redirect).</strong> This option is used when you want to send poeple to a different website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s see <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-confirmation-wpforms/\">how to set up a simple form confirmation in WPForms</a> so you can customize the message site visitors will see when they fill out a Girl Scout Cookie order form on your website.</p>\n<p>To start, click on the <strong>Confirmation</strong> tab in the Form Editor under <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, select the type of confirmation type you’d like to create. For this example, we’ll select <strong>Message</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246854\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png\" alt=\"Confirmation Message\" width=\"562\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message-300x155.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, customize the confirmation message to your liking and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you want to display different confirmations to site visitors based on their purchase behavior, be sure to read up on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-conditional-form-confirmations/\">how to create conditional form confirmations</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Configure the Payment Settings</h3>\n<p>If you decide to collect payments from your customers for their orders before delivering the cookies, you’ll need to configure the payment settings for your order form by connecting to your payment provider.</p>\n<p>But first, make sure you customize the Girl Scout Cookie order form template. The default template comes with simple Dropdown menus so people can select the number of each cookie type they want.</p>\n<p>In order to collect payments, you’ll need to exchange those Dropdown menus for either Single Items, Multiple Items, or Dropdown Items form fields, all of which are located under the <strong>Payment Fields</strong> section in the form builder.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371584\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/payment-form-fields.png\" alt=\"payment form fields\" width=\"562\" height=\"280\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/payment-form-fields.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/payment-form-fields-300x149.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>You can also add the Credit Card form field if you want to give customers the option to pay with a credit card, which is possible using the WPForms Stripe addon.</p>\n<p>For our example, we’ll replace the simple Dropdown menus with payment Dropdown Items form fields. In addition, we’ll add a Total form field so people always know their running total when purchasing cookies.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371583\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/new-payment-form-fields.png\" alt=\"new payment form fields\" width=\"562\" height=\"321\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/new-payment-form-fields.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/new-payment-form-fields-300x171.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Once your Girl Scout Cookie order form has the payment form fields you need, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, install and activate the right payment addon.</p>\n<p>For easy step by step instructions, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/install-use-paypal-addon-wpforms/\">installing and using the PayPal addon</a>. If you want to use Stripe, you’ll find similar instructions for <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-install-and-use-the-stripe-addon-with-wpforms/\">installing and using the Stripe addon here</a>.</p>\n<p>Then click on the <strong>Payments</strong> tab in the form builder to configure your payment settings.</p>\n<p>In our example, we’ll set up PayPal to process orders.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371591\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/girl-scout-cookie-order-form-payment-settings.jpg\" alt=\"girl scout cookie order form payment settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"365\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/girl-scout-cookie-order-form-payment-settings.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/girl-scout-cookie-order-form-payment-settings-300x195.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you’ll need to enter your PayPal email address, select the <strong>Production</strong> mode, choose <strong>Products and Services</strong>, and adjust other settings as needed.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-204042\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PayPal-Settings.png\" alt=\"PayPal Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"391\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PayPal-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/PayPal-Settings-300x209.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>After you’re done configuring the payment settings, click <strong>Save</strong> to store your changes.</p>\n<p>Be sure to check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-allow-users-to-choose-a-payment-method-on-your-form/\">allowing customers to choose their payment method</a> if you want to offer more than one payment option.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Enable Survey Reporting</h3>\n<p>To help you keep track of which types of cookies people order from your Girl Scout Cookie Order form, WPForms gives you the ability to enable survey reporting.</p>\n<p>To start, install and activate the Surveys and Polls addon so you can access survey reporting. For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-install-and-use-the-surveys-and-polls-addon/\">using the Surveys and Polls addon</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong> Surveys and Polls</strong>. Then, click on the <strong>Enable Survey Reporting</strong> checkbox. This will enable survey reporting sitewide.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-224833\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Enable-Survey-Reporting.png\" alt=\"Enable Survey Reporting\" width=\"562\" height=\"262\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Enable-Survey-Reporting.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Enable-Survey-Reporting-300x140.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>WPForms will collect survey results for any of the following form fields <strong>on all your site’s forms</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Single Line Text</li>\n<li>Paragraph Text</li>\n<li>Dropdown</li>\n<li>Checkboxes</li>\n<li>Multiple Choice</li>\n<li>Rating</li>\n<li>Likert Scale</li>\n<li>Net Promoter Score</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you don’t want to collect survey results for every form on your website, and only want results for your Girl Scout Cookie order form, unclick the <strong>Enable Survey Reporting</strong> checkbox under <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong> Surveys and Polls</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, return to the Form Editor, click on the field you want to enable reporting for, and under the <strong>Advanced Options</strong> section, check the <strong>Enable Survey Reporting</strong> box. Now only survey results on that particular form field will be collected.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371579\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/enable-survey-results.png\" alt=\"enable survey results\" width=\"562\" height=\"80\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/enable-survey-results.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/enable-survey-results-300x43.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Do this for each form field you want to collect results for.</p>\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">Keep in mind, if you exchange your simple Dropdown menus for Dropdown Items so you can collect payments from customers for their cookie orders on your form, you cannot collect results.</div>\n<p>Here’s a look at what your Girl Scout Cookie survey results might look like as people begin ordering from your daughter:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371580\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/girl-scout-cookie-survey-results.png\" alt=\"girl scout cookie survey results\" width=\"562\" height=\"347\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/girl-scout-cookie-survey-results.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/girl-scout-cookie-survey-results-300x185.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Each cookie type will be broken down into its own graph so you can easily calculate the total number of boxes people want.</p>\n<h3>Step 7: Add Your Girl Scout Cookie Order Form to Your Website</h3>\n<p>After you’ve created a Girl Scout Cookie order form, you need to add it to your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>WPForms allows you to add your forms to many locations on your website, including your blog posts, pages, and even <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-contact-form-in-wordpress-sidebar-widget/\">sidebar widgets</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the most common post/page embed option.</p>\n<p>To start, create a new post or page in WordPress and then click on the <strong>Add Form</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Next, select your Girl Scout Cookie order form in the modal popup and click <strong>Add Form</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-371577\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-girl-scout-cookie-form.png\" alt=\"add girl scout cookie form\" width=\"562\" height=\"341\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-girl-scout-cookie-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-girl-scout-cookie-form-300x182.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, publish your post or page so your form will appear on your website.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!

Knowing how much a website really costs ahead of time, no matter what kind of website you’re about to launch, will save you lots of time and money.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll share with you how much a website really costs so you can be prepared for the final “bill.”</p>\n<h3>What Do You Need to Build a Website?</h3>\n<p>If you’re looking to take the DIY route and opt out of hiring a professional to build and design your website (which will save you lots of money), it&#8217;s helpful to know what you’ll need to get started.</p>\n<p>No matter what kind of website you want to create, you’re going to need the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Domain name (e.g. Amazon.com, WPForms.com)</li>\n<li>Website builder (e.g. WordPress, Weebly, Shopify, Wix)</li>\n<li>Web hosting (depend on your website builder)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Domain Name</strong></p>\n<p>Your domain name is the URL (or website address) on the internet that appears in the browser of people’s computers. It’s also what people click on in search results when they want to access your website. Some examples of domain names include Amazon.com or WPForms.com.</p>\n<p>If you want to use a specific domain name for your website, you’ll need to register it. This registration will last for one year. If you want to keep using the same domain name, you’ll need to keep registering it each year in the form of a domain name renewal.</p>\n<p>If you decide you don’t want to use that domain name for your website at any time, all you have to do is let it expire. This then frees up that domain name for someone else to register and use.</p>\n<p>There are many domain name extensions to choose from including .com, .org, .net, .co, and .org. There are also extensions reserved for websites in specific countries. For instance, citizens or entities in the United States can use the extension .us to signal to site visitors they’re based in the United States.</p>\n<p><strong>Website Builder</strong></p>\n<p>Whether you’re new to website building or have a ton of experience, you’ll need to use a website builder to create a website. And the great thing is, website builders make building websites easy for people of all skill levels. They also allow you to add features for design and functionality so your website stands out and works properly.</p>\n<p>We always recommend using self-hosted WordPress as your website builder. The WordPress platform powers over 30% of all websites in the world. It also gives you the flexibility to customize your website in any way you want, and maintain complete control too.</p>\n<p>WordPress is a free and open source software. That said, to use self-hosted WordPress, you’ll need to buy a domain name and get web hosting. This way you can install WordPress and build your website on top of it.</p>\n<p><strong>Web Hosting</strong></p>\n<p>Web hosting companies store the files of your website and deliver content to site visitors when they click on your site.</p>\n<p>In other words, when a site visitor clicks on your website’s URL or types your domain name into the browser, they’ll be directed to the files your web host is storing for you on their server.</p>\n<p>Web hosts also help maintain internet connectivity and access to your website so people can always view your site no matter when they visit or where they access your site from.</p>\n<p>There are many different types of web hosting available. Here’s a quick rundown of the most popular:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Shared Hosting:</strong> when your site’s files are stored on a server, along with a bunch of other website files. Everyone shares resources so the cost of shared hosting is usually low. If someone’s website goes down or uses too many resources and causes a strain, your site may be affected.</li>\n<li><strong>Virtual Private Server (VPS) Hosting:</strong> similar to shared hosting. All sites are hosted on one physical server, but the server is then split into multiple virtual servers so resources don’t have to be shared by site owners. This reduces downtime because your site isn’t affected by other website’s overuse of resources. It also makes scaling your business a cinch, though there are some limits because of the physical server.</li>\n<li><strong>Dedicated Hosting:</strong> for large businesses that need their own physical server to store all their site’s files on. They comes with a set amount of resources, albeit a large amount, and cannot scale like cloud-based VPS hosting. You do have lots of control over the data, software, and hardware though.</li>\n<li><strong>Cloud Hosting:</strong> much like VPS hosting, cloud hosting is easy to scale. The difference is, there&#8217;s no need for a physical server since all resources are based in the cloud. This means there is an endless number of resources available.</li>\n<li><strong>WordPress Hosting:</strong> shared hosting for WordPress users. WordPress comes pre-installed on your hosting account and may come with additional services such as automatic updates, built-in security measures, and regular site backups.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now that you know the essential things you need to build a website, let’s take a look at what it really costs to get started. To make things easier on you, we’ll break the cost of building a website into a few categories based on budget:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Small website with a limited budget</li>\n<li>Advanced website with more features</li>\n<li>eCommerce website</li>\n</ul>\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s look at some things to think about before you build a website.</p>\n<h3>Things to Consider Before Building a Website</h3>\n<p>Before you jump into building a website, it’s important you have a plan in place so you don’t overspend.</p>\n<p>Here are some things to consider before building your site, choosing a web host, and deciding which WordPress plugins to install on your site.</p>\n<p><strong>1. What’s your budget?</strong></p>\n<p>Knowing how much money you realistically have to spend on a website will help guide you through the site-building process.</p>\n<p>Before making any final decisions when it comes to spending money, double-check your finances and make sure you can afford it. Oftentimes there are other ways to spend less and get the same functionality and design.</p>\n<p><strong>2. What features will you need?</strong></p>\n<p>After determining your budget, it’s time to figure out what type of website you plan to build and what features you&#8217;ll need to achieve your goals.</p>\n<p>Create a list of must-have features and put aside the features that can wait until you start to turn a profit or something changes with your budget. This will make site building easier, faster, and less stressful. You can always add more to your site as it grows.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Do you need to hire a professional?</strong></p>\n<p>Sometimes you might think you can build a website all on your own, only to realize later that you actually need a custom build. If you’re in need of a custom theme, and a website that performs in a very specific way, you might need to hire a professional developer to help you.</p>\n<p>Rates for a WordPress developer vary widely, ranging anywhere from $20 to $100 an hour. Make sure before you hire someone that you cannot achieve your goals on your own. That way you don’t overspend on a site build when you don’t need to.</p>\n<h3>The Cost of a Building a Small Website</h3>\n<p>Building a small website doesn’t cost a lot of money when compared to building a large advanced website or an online store. That said, for those just starting out, even the cost of registering a domain name and paying for web hosting can be a little pricey.</p>\n<p>A domain name will usually cost you around $14.99/year. Decent web hosting will cost about $7.99/month. That means that to start a small website, you’ll have to <strong>invest about $110.87 a year</strong> to keep it running.</p>\n<p>Luckily, we’ve struck up a deal with <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost</a> to offer website owners a free domain name, free SSL certificate for added security, and over 60% off on web hosting services.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-374593\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-hosting-deal.png\" alt=\"bluehost hosting deal\" width=\"562\" height=\"336\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-hosting-deal.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-hosting-deal-300x179.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Bluehost is an officially recommended hosting provider by WordPress.org, making it one of the best options when it comes to web hosting.

You can reach a broader audience by going global and get started without spending near as much as someone trying to open a brick-and-mortar shop.</p>\n<p>To start an online store, you’ll need a domain name and web hosting, just like any other type of website. That’s why we recommend using the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/bluehost-woocommerce/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Bluehost WooCommerce plan</a> when starting out.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-374594\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-deal.png\" alt=\"bluehost woocommerce hosting deal\" width=\"562\" height=\"302\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-deal.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/bluehost-woocommerce-hosting-deal-300x161.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>The Bluehost WooCommerce plan comes packed with features you’ll need to get your online shop up and running:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Free domain name</li>\n<li>Automatic WooCommerce installation</li>\n<li>Free SLL certificate</li>\n<li>Unmetered bandwidth so your site can scale uninterrupted</li>\n<li>Free dedicated IP address</li>\n<li>Dedicated support on standby 24/7</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When you use a free eCommerce platform like WooCommerce, and utilize web hosting from Bluehost, you can expect to <strong>shell out approximately $190/year</strong> to get started.</p>\n<p>If you want to install premium WordPress plugins and themes or extend the functionality of your site using premium WooCommerce addons, the price of your site will increase.</p>\n<h3>Don’t Overpay Building Your Website</h3>\n<p>When it comes to building your first website, no matter what you overall goals are, it’s best to start small and spend more later.</p>\n<p>It’s also helpful to keep an eye out for deals and discounts on premium WordPress themes and plugins to save some money when a premium solution is necessary.</p>\n<p>And don’t forget, as your site grows and you begin to scale your business and generate more revenue, make sure to optimize it so it renders seamlessly for site visitors.

WPForms</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365159\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpforms-wordpress-lead-generation-plugin.png\" alt=\"wpforms wordpress lead generation plugin\" width=\"562\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpforms-wordpress-lead-generation-plugin.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/wpforms-wordpress-lead-generation-plugin-300x97.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms</a> is the best contact form builder plugin that allows you to integrate your email marketing tools with your WordPress forms. It comes integrated with <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/features/constant-contact/\">Constant Contact</a>, so you can easily create newsletter signup forms to <a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/beginners-guide-to-email-marketing/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">grow your email list</a>.</p>\n<p>You can also find several addons that connect your form with your favorite email marketing tools such as <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/aweber-addon/\">AWeber</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/mailchimp-addon/\">MailChimp</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/getresponse-addon/\">GetResponse</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/campaign-monitor-addon/\">Campaign Monitor</a>, and <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/drip-addon/\">Drip</a>.</p>\n<p>With WPForms, you can grow your email list in two ways: Either create a signup form specifically to build your email list or add an <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-mailchimp-signup-checkbox-to-your-contact-form/\">email signup checkbox</a> to your regular contact forms, so you can add your visitors into your list automatically when it’s selected.</p>\n<p>Best of all, you can embed your lead generation form anywhere in your WordPress site like posts, pages, sidebar widgets, and footers using shortcodes.</p>\n<p>With WPForms, the possibilities are endless and you&#8217;re not limited to just creating newsletter signup forms. You can create any types of forms like <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-simple-order-form-in-wordpress/\">order forms</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-a-custom-login-form-in-wordpress/\">login forms</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/user-registration-addon/\">registration forms</a>, <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/create-a-survey-form-in-wordpress-step-by-step/\">survey forms</a>, and more.</p>\n<h3>2. OptinMonster</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-50011\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/optinmonster.jpg\" alt=\"optinmonster\" width=\"562\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/optinmonster.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/optinmonster-300x97.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></a></p>\n<p>OptinMonster is the <a href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/showcase/best-email-marketing-services/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">best lead generation software</a> that allows you to create beautiful optin forms that are optimized for the highest conversion rates. With OptinMonster, integration with your favorite email marketing tools such as AWeber, MailChimp, InfusionSoft, GetResponse, and Constant Contact is a breeze.</p>\n<p>The main difference between WPForms and OptinMonster is that WPForms is an easy to use contact form WordPress plugin. Whereas OptinMonster is a platform independent optin form builder tool that lets you create multiple types of forms such as lightbox popups, floating bars, slide-ins, sidebar forms, and more.</p>\n<p>All you have to do is create beautiful optin forms by logging into your OptinMonster account. From there, publish it on your site using a WordPress plugin installed on your site.</p>\n<p>A few more benefits of OptinMonster are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/features/exit-intent/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Exit-intent technology</a>: </strong>You can prompt your website visitors to subscribe to your list at the precise moment they are about to leave your website.</li>\n<li><strong>A/B testing</strong>: You can test all elements of your forms such as headlines, copy, button, and even different designs to see what works best to boost conversions.</li>\n<li><strong>Page level targeting</strong>: You can build a hyper targeted and segmented email list with targeted messages on specific pages or categories.</li>\n<li><strong>Built-in Analytics: </strong>With its built-in analytics tool, you can see which optins are performing the best.</li>\n<li>&#8230;and much more.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>You can <a href=\"http://optinmonster.com/features/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">see a full list of OptinMonster features here</a>.</p>\n<h3>3. Yoast SEO</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365163\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yoast-seo-wordpress.png\" alt=\"yoast seo wordpress lead generation plugin\" width=\"562\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yoast-seo-wordpress.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yoast-seo-wordpress-300x97.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /><br />\nIf you’re looking to build an email list, you’ll need to attract targeted visitors to your website who are interested in reading your content, engaging with your website, and most importantly subscribing to your list.</p>\n<p>With the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Yoast SEO plugin</a>, you can attract the right leads to your website by optimizing your site for search engines. It takes care of the all the technical optimization you need for your site.</p>\n<p>Focusing on the right keywords for your site is an essential part of SEO. It ensures that you attract the right visitors that are likely to convert into leads.</p>\n<p>Yoast SEO requires you to choose a focus keyword when you’re publishing content, and then makes sure that you use it appropriately in that content.</p>\n<p>It also comes with a snippet preview that allows you to see how your post or page will look when it appears in search results. This includes a preview of both the title and meta descriptions you define. This preview is helpful for optimizing your organic results so that you can improve the click-through rate and possibly drive more traffic to your site.</p>\n<h3>4. LiveChat</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365156\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/livechat-wordpress-lead-generation-plugin.png\" alt=\"livechat wordpress lead generation plugin\" width=\"562\" height=\"182\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/livechat-wordpress-lead-generation-plugin.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/livechat-wordpress-lead-generation-plugin-300x97.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In the previous section, we talked about driving targeted traffic to your website by optimizing your site for search engines.</p>\n<p>If you’re attracting the right audience to your site and you’re not seeing many conversions, you need to find out why. One of the best ways to figure it out is by asking your potential leads and customers about what keeps them from subscribing.</p>\n<p>One way to do this is by adding live chat functionality on your website so you can talk to site visitors. If you’re looking for a live chat support software for WordPress websites, you might want to consider installing <a class=\"thirstylink\" title=\"LiveChat Inc\" href=\"https://wpforms.com/refer/livechat-inc/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">LiveChat</a>.</p>\n<p>It allows you to easily integrate with popular email marketing tools, so you can connect with them and also grow your email list. It also offers beautifully designed apps for you and your agents to use on mobile, desktop, and tablets.</p>\n<h3>5. Yoast Comment Hacks</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365160\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yoast-comment-hacks.png\" alt=\"yoast comment hacks\" width=\"562\" height=\"180\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yoast-comment-hacks.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/yoast-comment-hacks-300x96.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Allowing comments on your blog is a great way to get site visitors to engage. People can ask questions, offer different solutions, and interact with one another. Comments are a great way to establish yourself as an authority and boost your site’s SEO too.</p>\n<p>But the default WordPress comment system lacks the flexibility and functionality to bring engaged site visitors back to your website after they’ve left a comment. That’s because when someone leaves a comment on your WordPress site, they see the same page with the only difference being their submitted comment.</p>\n<p>To convert site visitors leaving comments on your website, use a WordPress lead generation plugin like <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/yoast-comment-hacks/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Yoast Comment Hacks</a>. With it, you can redirect first-time commenters to a thank you page on your website that also has an optin form encouraging them to subscribe to your email list.</p>\n<h3>6. Subscribe to Comments Reloaded</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365158\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/subscribe-to-comments-reloaded.png\" alt=\"subscribe to comments reloaded\" width=\"562\" height=\"170\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/subscribe-to-comments-reloaded.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/subscribe-to-comments-reloaded-300x91.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Another common problem with the default WordPress comment system is that once someone submits a comment on your site, the only way they’ll ever know if someone has replied is if they continue to come back to your site to check. Most people won’t do this, meaning you are losing out on opportunities to convert those site visitors into subscribers or customers.</p>\n<p>The best solution to this problem is to use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/subscribe-to-comments-reloaded/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">Subscribe to Comments Reloaded</a> lead generation plugin.</p>\n<p>This way, when someone leaves a comment on your site, they have the option to subscribe so that when new comments are left on the content they engaged with, they are notified by email. Your site visitors will then return to your site, giving you additional chances to encourage them to convert.</p>\n<h3>7. OneSignal – Web Push Notifications</h3>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-365157\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/onesignal.png\" alt=\"onesignal\" width=\"562\" height=\"181\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/onesignal.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/onesignal-300x97.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Increasing user engagement, and getting site visitors to return to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-much-does-a-website-really-cost-beginners-guide/\">your WordPress website</a>, is one of the best ways to approach lead generation. Some people will visit your site for the first time and leave without subscribing or buying anything. But that doesn’t mean they’re not interested in what you have to offer.</p>\n<p>However, with so many websites to choose from, unless you explicitly remind people to return, the chances of a non-converted site visitor returning is slim. Using the free WordPress lead generation plugin <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/onesignal-free-web-push-notifications/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\">OneSignal – Web Push Notifications</a> helps with this.</p>\n<p>With it, site visitors can opt in to receive push notifications from you when you post new blog content on your site. This way, when people are not actively on your site, and new content is published, they receive a notification letting them know.</p>\n<p>This drives re-engagement with your site. It also keeps people updated on all the latest happenings and even helps convert people into subscribers, new customers, or even repeat customers.</p>\n<p>We hope this article helps you find the WordPress lead generation plugins for your needs.

Whether it be a running, biking, or swimming race, creating an online race registration form gives you an easy way to register people that want to participate in your event.</p>\n<p>In this article, we’ll show you how to create an online race registration form in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>The Benefits of Using an Online Race Registration Form</h3>\n<p>Giving people a chance to register online for a race you&#8217;re hosting offers both you and your participants many benefits.</p>\n<p><strong>For Race Organizers</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some of the top reasons why race organizers should use an online race registration form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Save Time.</strong> Creating an online race registration form is easy when you use <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms</a>. From there, all you have to do is let people register. Forget having to sort through the mail, filter registrations, and manually process payments. Instead, let your online form do all the hard work for you.</li>\n<li><strong>Better Race Management.</strong> WPForms makes managing all form submissions easy by centralizing form entries in one location, right in the backend of your website. You’ll never have to manually enter registrant information into spreadsheets and you can even export registrations to CSV files.</li>\n<li><strong>Improved Marketing.</strong> Getting the word out about your race is a cinch when you allow people to sign up online. Using email marketing campaigns, social media posting, and push notifications, anyone can find out about your race and rush to sign up with the click of link.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>For Participants</strong></p>\n<p>Here are some of the top benefits of registering online for a racing event:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Save Time.</strong> Just like race organizers, participants save time when they register online. Online forms can be simple and to the point and a submission is as easy as clicking a button. People don’t have to fill out paper forms and mail in entries hoping they don’t get lost.</li>\n<li><strong>Secure Online Payments.</strong> With secure online payments, participants will know their money is in the right hands and not lost in the mail. And, since WPForms integrates with both Stripe and PayPal, people registering will feel comfortable paying their fees online.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Confirmations and Notifications.</strong> With an online race registration form, participants receive immediate conformation their registration has been processed, as well as email notifications, complete with any information they may need to know about the upcoming event.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, now that you know some of the benefits of using an online race registration form, let’s see how you can create one for your WordPress website using WPForms.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create an Online Race Registration Form in WordPress</h3>\n<p>Using WPForms is the easiest way to create a race registration form in WordPress. WPForms comes with the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-templates-pack-addon/\">Form Templates Pack addon</a> that allows you to choose from 100+ pre-built templates for every niche and industry, including an online race registration form template.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms plugin</a>. For more details, see this step by step guide on <a title=\"Step by step guide on How to Install a WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to install a plugin in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, you’ll need to install and activate the Form Templates Pack addon.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Addon</strong> and find the one labeled <strong>Form Templates Pack addon</strong>.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Install Addon</strong> and then <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-291194\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon.png\" alt=\"form templates pack addon\" width=\"562\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon-300x103.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you’ll need to create a new form.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Add New</strong>, and name your form. Then, scroll down to the section labeled <strong>Additional Templates</strong> and type “Online Race Registration Form” into the search bar.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370816\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-race-registration-form-template.png\" alt=\"online race registration form template\" width=\"562\" height=\"283\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-race-registration-form-template.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/online-race-registration-form-template-300x151.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>When the pre-built online race registration form template loads, most of the work is already done for you. In fact, you’ll find the following fields in the form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Single Line Text</li>\n<li>Dropdown</li>\n<li>Multiple Choice</li>\n<li>Paragraph Text</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370817\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/race-registration-form.png\" alt=\"race registration form\" width=\"562\" height=\"372\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/race-registration-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/race-registration-form-300x199.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to see the online race registration form template in action, head over and check out our <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/demo/online-race-registration-form-demo/\">sample online race registration form demo</a>.</p>\n<p>You can add additional fields to your form by dragging them from the left hand panel to the right hand panel.</p>\n<p>Then, click on the field to make any changes. You can also click on a form field and drag it to rearrange the order on your race registration form.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want to collect race registration fees for your event, add a Single Item, Multiple Item, or Dropdown Items form field to your race registration form template.</p>\n<p>For our example, we’ll add a Single Item form field and require a flat fee payment for entering the race.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370814\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-payment-fields.png\" alt=\"add payment fields\" width=\"562\" height=\"384\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-payment-fields.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-payment-fields-300x205.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Make sure to select the <strong>Required</strong> checkbox so new race participants cannot submit their race registration form without paying the race fee.</p>\n<p>For help with integrating your race registration form with PayPal, be sure to check out this easy to follow tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/install-use-paypal-addon-wpforms/\">how to install and use the PayPal addon</a>. And if you want to integrate it with Stripe, check out this tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-install-and-use-the-stripe-addon-with-wpforms/\">how to install and use the Stripe addon</a>.</p>\n<p>When your online race registration form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your Race Registration Form Settings</h3>\n<p>To start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can configure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Name.</strong> Rename your form here.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Description.</strong> Give your form a description.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Button Text.</strong> Customize the copy on the submit button. For instance, you can change the button to say “Join the Race.”</li>\n<li><strong>Spam Prevention.</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-a-spam-free-contact-form-without-captcha/\">Enable the anti-spam honeypot feature</a> to prevent spam race submissions and <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a>. This feature is automatically enabled on all WordPress forms. If you decide to use another form of spam prevention, you can either unclick this option or continue using this feature with other spam prevention features such as recaptcha.</li>\n<li><strong>GDPR Enhancements.</strong> You can disable the storing of entry information and user details, such as IP addresses and user agents, in an effort to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-gdpr-compliant-forms/\">comply with GDPR requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Race Registration Form Notifications</h3>\n<p>Notifications are a great way to send an email whenever someone registers for a racing event on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, unless you disable this feature, whenever someone submits a race registration form on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">use smart tags</a>, you can also send a notification to your participants when they fill out your form, letting them know you received it and will be in contact shortly if needed. This assures people their entry has gone through properly.</p>\n<p>You can also add important information to the notification about the upcoming race. For instance, provide directions, start times, a list of what to bring, and parking information.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>You can send more than one notification when someone registers for your racing event on your site. For instance, you can send a notification to yourself, your participants, and your event organizer.</p>\n<p>For help doing this, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want to keep branding across your emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Your Race Registration Form Confirmations</h3>\n<p>Form confirmations are messages that display to people once they submit a race registration form on your website. They let people know that their registration has gone through and offer you the chance to let them know what the next steps are.</p>\n<p>WPForms has three confirmation types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong> This is the default confirmation type in WPForms. When someone submits an online race registration form, a simple message confirmation will appear letting them know their entry to your racing event was processed.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Page.</strong> This confirmation type will take registrants to a specific web page on your site thanking them for their form entry. You can also redirect them to a page providing more information about the event for their convenience. For help doing this, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-redirect-users-after-wordpress-form-submit/\">redirecting people to a thank you page</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to URL (Redirect).</strong> This option is used when you want to send poeple to a different website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s see <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-confirmation-wpforms/\">how to set up a simple form confirmation in WPForms</a> so you can customize the message site visitors will see when they fill out an online race registration form on your website.</p>\n<p>To start, click on the <strong>Confirmation</strong> tab in the Form Editor under <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, select the type of confirmation type you’d like to create. For this example, we’ll select <strong>Message</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246854\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png\" alt=\"Confirmation Message\" width=\"562\" height=\"290\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Confirmation-Message-300x155.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, customize the confirmation message to your liking and click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<p>If you want to display different confirmations to site visitors based on their behavior, be sure to read up on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-conditional-form-confirmations/\">how to create conditional form confirmations</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 5: Configure Race Registration Form Access Controls</h3>\n<p>WPForms comes with a <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-locker-addon/\">Form Locker addon</a> that gives website owners a way to configure form permissions and access controls.</p>\n<p>To access these settings, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>Form Locker</strong>. Here, you’ll see 4 different settings:</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370824\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings.png\" alt=\"form locker settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"359\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/form-locker-settings-300x192.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable password protection so only those with the password can fill out your form. You can give people the password in your email campaigns or on social media posts to narrow down the number of random form submissions you receive.</li>\n<li>Schedule start and end dates for your race registration forms so people can’t register right before the race begins.</li>\n<li>Limit the number of form entries you’ll accept and control the number of participants.</li>\n<li>Allow only those that have logged into your website to submit an online race registration form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The Form Locker addon also gives you the ability to limit race entries to one person. For detailed help with form permissions, check out this documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-install-and-use-the-form-locker-addon-in-wpforms/\">how to install and use the Form Locker addon</a>.</p>\n<h3>Step 6: Add Your Race Registration Form to Your Website</h3>\n<p>After you’ve created an online race registration form, you need to add it to your WordPress website.</p>\n<p>WPForms allows you to add your forms to many locations on your website, including your blog posts, pages, and even <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-add-a-contact-form-in-wordpress-sidebar-widget/\">sidebar widgets</a>.</p>\n<p>Let’s take a look at the most common post/page embed option.</p>\n<p>To start, create a new post or page in WordPress and then click on the <strong>Add Form</strong> button.</p>\n<p>Next, select your employee information form in the modal popup and click <strong>Add Form</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-370813\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-online-race-registration-form.png\" alt=\"add online race registration form\" width=\"562\" height=\"338\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-online-race-registration-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/add-online-race-registration-form-300x180.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Then, publish your post or page so your form will appear on your website.</p>\n<p>And there you have it!

It documents basic personal information, emergency contact information, and data related to the their position within the company.</p>\n<p>Here are some of the most important things to ask new employees when they fill out your employee information form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full name</li>\n<li>Contact information including email and phone</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Date of birth</li>\n<li>Job title</li>\n<li>Department and supervisor</li>\n<li>Office contact information</li>\n<li>Start date and salary</li>\n<li>Emergency contact information</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It’s important you collect information from people once they start working for you. It’s also a good idea to encourage employees to update their information regularly so you always have the most recent information.</p>\n<p>Now let’s see how to create an employee information form in WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Create an Employee Information Form in WordPress</h3>\n<p>Using WPForms is the easiest way to create a new employee information form in WordPress. WPForms comes with the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/addons/form-templates-pack-addon/\">Form Templates Pack addon</a> that allows you to choose from 100+ pre-built templates for every niche and industry, including an employee information form template.</p>\n<p>The first thing you’ll need to do is install and activate the <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/pricing/\">WPForms plugin</a>. For more details, see this step by step guide on <a title=\"Step by step guide on How to Install a WordPress Plugin\" href=\"http://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/step-by-step-guide-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin-for-beginners/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">how to install a plugin in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Next, you’ll need to install and activate the Form Templates Pack addon.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Addon</strong> and find the one labeled <strong>Form Templates Pack addon</strong>.</p>\n<p>Click <strong>Install Addon</strong> and then <strong>Activate</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-291194\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon.png\" alt=\"form templates pack addon\" width=\"562\" height=\"193\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/form-templates-pack-addon-300x103.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Now you’ll need to create a new form.</p>\n<p>To do this, go to <strong>WPForms</strong> » <strong>Add New</strong>, and name your form. Then, scroll down to the section labeled <strong>Additional Templates</strong> and type “Employee Information Form” into the search bar.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364620\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-information-form-template.png\" alt=\"employee information form template\" width=\"562\" height=\"287\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-information-form-template.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-information-form-template-300x153.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>When the pre-built employee information form template loads, most of the work is already done for you. In fact, you’ll find the following fields in the form:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Section Divider</li>\n<li>Name</li>\n<li>Email</li>\n<li>Phone</li>\n<li>Address</li>\n<li>Date / Time</li>\n<li>Single Line Text</li>\n<li>Single Item</li>\n</ul>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364619\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-information-form.png\" alt=\"employee information form\" width=\"562\" height=\"447\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-information-form.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/employee-information-form-300x239.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>If you want to see the employee information form template in action, head over and check out our <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/demo/employee-information-form-demo/\">sample employee information form demo</a>.</p>\n<p>You can add additional fields to your form by dragging them from the left hand panel to the right hand panel.</p>\n<p>Then, click on the field to make any changes. You can also click on a form field and drag it to rearrange the order on your employee information form.</p>\n<p>For example, if you want people to upload an image of themselves to be used for their ID badge, add a <strong>File Upload</strong> form field to your employee information form template.</p>\n<p>This way, people can choose a photo that they like. Plus, it saves you the time and hassle of having to hire a photographer to take pictures of every new employee you hire.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-364621\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/file-upload-example-1.png\" alt=\"file upload example\" width=\"562\" height=\"273\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/file-upload-example-1.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/file-upload-example-1-300x146.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Make sure to select the <strong>Required</strong> checkbox so new employees cannot submit their employee information form without uploading a picture.</p>\n<p>When your employee information form looks the way you want it to, click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 2: Configure Your Employee Information Form Settings</h3>\n<p>To start, go to <strong>Settings</strong> » <strong>General</strong>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246850\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms General Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"443\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-General-Settings-300x236.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>Here you can configure the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Form Name.</strong> Rename your form here.</li>\n<li><strong>Form Description.</strong> Give your form a description.</li>\n<li><strong>Submit Button Text.</strong> Customize the copy on the submit button.</li>\n<li><strong>Spam Prevention.</strong> <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-build-a-spam-free-contact-form-without-captcha/\">Enable the anti-spam honeypot feature</a> to prevent spam form submissions and <a href=\"https://www.wpbeginner.com/wordpress-security/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">keep your website secure</a>. This feature is automatically enabled on all WordPress forms. If you decide to use another form of spam prevention, you can either unclick this option or continue using this feature with other spam prevention features such as recaptcha.</li>\n<li><strong>GDPR Enhancements.</strong> You can disable the storing of entry information and user details, such as IP addresses and user agents, in an effort to <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-create-gdpr-compliant-forms/\">comply with GDPR requirements</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>\n<h3>Step 3: Configure Your Employee Information Form Notifications</h3>\n<p>Notifications are a great way to send an email whenever someone submits an employee information form on your website.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246852\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png\" alt=\"WPForms Notifications Settings\" width=\"562\" height=\"228\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings.png 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/WPForms-Notifications-Settings-300x122.png 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<p>In fact, unless you disable this feature, whenever someone submits a form on your site, you’ll get a notification about it.</p>\n<p>If you <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-use-smart-tags-in-wpforms/\">use smart tags</a>, you can also send a notification to your new employee when they fill out your form, letting them know you received it and will be in contact shortly if needed. This assures people their entry has gone through properly.</p>\n<p>For help with this step, check out our documentation on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-notification-wpforms/\">how to set up form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>You can send more than one notification when a new employee information form is submitted on your site. For instance, you can send a notification to yourself, your employee, and your HR department or other administrator.</p>\n<p>For help doing this, check out our step by step tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-create-multiple-form-notifications-in-wordpress-forms/\">how to send multiple form notifications in WordPress</a>.</p>\n<p>Lastly, if you want to keep branding across your emails consistent, you can check out this guide on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/how-to-add-custom-header-image-in-your-wpforms-email-template/\">adding a custom header to your email template</a>.</p>\n<p><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-211599\" src=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg\" alt=\"Custom Email Header\" width=\"562\" height=\"314\" srcset=\"https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header.jpg 562w, https://wpforms.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Custom-Email-Header-300x168.jpg 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 562px) 100vw, 562px\" /></p>\n<h3>Step 4: Configure Your Employee Information Form Confirmations</h3>\n<p>Form confirmations are messages that display to employees once they submit their employee information form on your website. They let people know that their information has been collected and offer you the chance to let them know what the next steps are.</p>\n<p>WPForms has three confirmation types:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Message.</strong> This is the default confirmation type in WPForms. When someone submits an employee information form, a simple message confirmation will appear letting them know their form was processed.</li>\n<li><strong>Show Page.</strong> This confirmation type will take site visitors to a specific web page on your site thanking them for their form entry. For help doing this, check out our tutorial on <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/how-to-redirect-users-after-wordpress-form-submit/\">redirecting people to a thank you page</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Go to URL (Redirect).</strong> This option is used when you want to send site visitors to a different website.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let’s see <a href=\"https://wpforms.com/docs/setup-form-confirmation-wpforms/\">how to set up a simple form confirmation in WPForms</a> so you can customize the message site visitors will see when they fill out an employee information form on your website.</p>\n<p>To start, click on the <strong>Confirmation</strong> tab in the Form Editor under <strong>Settings</strong>.</p>\n<p>Next, select the type of confirmation type you’d like to create.

The headline Touch Bar – a thin \nOLED display at the top of the keyboard which can be used for any number\n of things, whether that be auto-suggesting words as you type or \noffering Touch ID so you can log in with just your fingerprint – is \nagain included. It\'s certainly retained Apple\'s sense of style, but it \ncomes at a cost. This is a pricey machine, so you may want to consider \none of the Windows alternatives. If you\'re open to switching to a PC, \ndefinitely consider the XPS 13 or the excellent MateBook X Pro.
